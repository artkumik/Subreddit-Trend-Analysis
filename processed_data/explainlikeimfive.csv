[Image for Reference] (http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/World_line.svg/481px-World_line.svg.png)

Most of us have grown on a Euclidean system in which we have 3 dimensions (x, y, z) in which each component is independent of the other.  However the universe doesn't work that way, instead it works on the principle of space time.  So we do still have our 3 Euclidean dimensions except now we refer to them as Spatial dimensions.  The Minkowski Space is a space in which time is also included in our geometry as a temporal dimension.  Now here comes the questions.

1. How would you describe a point on the Minkowski Space? For instance, on a basic XYZ coordinate system we'd have (x, y, z).  Would we simply just have (x, y, z, t) or is there another way of formatting?

2. If [this] (http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/World_line.svg/481px-World_line.svg.png) coordinate system is a good representation, where exactly would you place a point on it?  For instance, how would we place something like (1, 1, 1, 1) ?

Any answers would be appreciated!

According to this link, (it may not be true, it *is* DPRK) North Korea has the lowest labor cost of any Asian country.

Why wouldn't businesses take advantage of that? I mean, yeah, it's *good* that North Korea isn't getting business but what's stopping a bunch of greedy CEOs? Is it because North Korea may try to keep some of the product? Or fears of... instability of the building? I really have no idea."

I understand what overtones are, their ratios, etc. I understand what a standing wave is and how it is produced.

What I don't get is how an air column can vibrate at and produce a fundamental frequency ***and*** its harmonic frequencies at the same time. Wouldn't the shorter wavelengths disrupt the longer ones and cease the fundamental from sounding?

Also, why does a clarinet/any instrument emphasize different overtones? What about the construction changes which overtones are resonating?

The first one I noticed was in **Dragon Ball**.

* Master Shen is known as the Crane Hermit and is a rival school to that of Master Roshi, the Turtle Hermit.

The next is in **Kung Fu Panda**.

* Po's master, Master Shifu, was taught by Master Oogway (a turtle). In Kung Fu Panda 2, Lord Shen (a ~~crane~~ peacock) seeks to take over China but is defeated by Po, who was taught by Shifu, who was taught by Oogway, essentially making him the student of the turtle.

Comparing a chip design to a city, where the wires are roads, the registers are warehouses, etc, might be understandable to more people.

I'm thinking that the ARM chip design might be similar to an old Soviet Style city, where you have one factory and one housing complex connected by one road. Not a lot of choices or flexibility, but extremely efficient. Is this a valid analogy?

""Your Honor, may I please approach the bench?""

First of all, let me say I think judges are great. The judicial system is complicated, but pretty awesome. I'm not saying I think judges should be disrespected, but rather that our cultural attitude toward them seems almost unique.

Why is it that we have the reverent view of judges that we do? They have an important job that requires a lot of experience and responsibility, but that is true of a lot of professions: doctors, engineers, climatologists, teachers--hell, lifeguards. We surround judges, though, with a level of ceremony that is almost theatrical. When a judge enters the room, we all stand in humble unison. We employ arcane terms of address like ""the court"" when speaking to them like they're royalty. If you call a judge ""Joe"" or ""Mr. Smith"" instead of ""Your Honor,"" you will be thrown in jail. If you do that to the President of the United States, you'll probably just not be invited back.

Where do these rules come from about how you are or are not allowed to talk to a judge? What laws govern this stuff? Why don't we extend this same level of ceremony to any other profession? Are they just rituals, or is there a good reason for any of it? I hope this isn't too insolent to ask, but is it just because judges can unilaterally control life and death in their courtrooms and lawyers are trying to suck up in order to win cases?"

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assets_owned_by_Disney

So, these are the two biggest examples. How in the ever living fuck does that even work? Some of these things are COMPLETELY different from one another.

So for example, Disney owns Star Wars and Marvel (already cash guaranteed) but apparently owns a lot of other things such as ESPN, and ABC. Each of these things have their own CEO.

SO how does that work? Can Bog Iger tell Kevin Feige (Marvel Studios) what to do, technically, since he's CEO of the entire company and Feige only is president of a subsidiary? Are they largely independent? If so, how far does that independence go before they are reigned in by people at the top? How is micromanaging prohibited?

This was very confusing to me because immediately the overwhelming response to this was ""HIV has evolved. This makes sense because keeping the host body alive would increase survivability for the disease. Therefore, HIV has evolved *not* to cause AIDS."" The reason this doesn't make sense to me is because it implies that somehow HIV ""realized"" it was killing its host and ""decided"" not to anymore, which is not how the blind process of Natural Selection works.

As I understand it, Natural Selection is a completely blind process by which weaker cells/viruses of a bacterium/virus are killed off and only the strongest cells/viruses remain. Then, the remaining strong cells reproduce and their ""offspring"" are strong and those ones breed and so on. This is how ""Superbugs"" are created and this is why antibiotics some day might not work right?

But this ""HIV has stopped causing AIDS"" thing does not follow Natural Selection. Obviously, HIV originally evolved to create AIDS, so by Natural Selection it should keep getting better and better at doing that. But now, somehow, HIV has stopped doing this and changed course. The only explanation I'm seeing implies that somehow HIV ""realized"" it was part of a larger system and that its actions were detrimental to that system and so it changed. Since this is not a blind process like Natural Selection, are we dealing with a new kind of sentient evolution like mankind? Is it possible that HIV has sentience? "

Is there any damage happening to my brain due me stimulating these receptors to the point of fatigue?

Also, it's commonly said that bongs are healthier, but I've heard some people say that the water filters a negligible amount of tar and that you're still pretty much getting as much tar as a joint.

Right now, my goal is to study education or educational psychology, so I could in some way and at a large scale affect how education is practiced in my country. My ultimate career goal is this. 
I've been told countless times graduate school is ruthlessly competitive. And that I should definitely apply for a summer internship. So that's what I've been trying to do... For the last month.
This sort of thing overwhelms me. Last week I was looking through a list of programs I was provided by some of my professors. But as I started looking through them I got freaked out and I stopped. I think what most freaked me out was the fact that all the pages were so different. Some of them were pages that sent out applications to multiple universities. Some made it seem like I would be making my own independent research proposals. Others made it seem like I would be assisting doctors on their research. And it all seems really heterogeneous and confusing for someone who has never had this sort of experience and has no relatives or friends to ask about this. I've tried talking to my professors about this but they all seem to expect me to know all the ins and outs of applying for this sort of thing.

Basically, give the county more money and don't commit any offenses for a year and the county won't report the ticket to my in-state BMV. It has since been the year, my insurance rates never increased, and I have no points on my record. However, if I navigate to that county's website I can still find records of my ticket and history that I paid a deferral fee.

My question is, as the ticket was deferred and out-of-state: (1) can I  say that I have not been convicted of a traffic offense and (2) will my employer be able to see the ticket in a check?

Let's say we have a set/static time of one minute. Cut that time in half , so 30 seconds, and you travel one mile. Cut that time in half again, 15 seconds, and you travel another mile. So by cutting the time in half over and over again, you should get infinitly close to zero, but never reach it. This basically means you are gonna travel an infinite amount of miles in that minute.

The closer we get to zero, the faster and faster we move. And since we can get infinitly close to zero, we can achieve infinite speeds.

Once again, let's say we know this child about to be born will live to be 100. So do the every half of the time you move a set distance, but instead of a mile, we move 1/1000000 of an inch. Without actually doing the math to get near the speed of light (mainly because it'll take a long while), I can do a rough, rough guess to where it would be. It'd be at the age of 99.*enter an incredibly large finite number*. Now cut the time in half again, and you've just traveled faster than light, and you will continue too.

1,0,"ELI5: In a typical American wine and beer section, why are there usually 1000+ wine labels and only around 50 beer labels?","There's several reasons why this seems strange to me. First because -I think- quality beer is relatively much cheaper, quicker and easier to produce than quality wine. 

You can produce beer anywhere in the world, whereas good wine grapes only grow in very specific regions. And the grapes are only usable for making wine, whereas most of the ingredients for beers can also be used to make other foods, so you don't have to use land and produce that's dedicated to only one purpose. 

Plus you have to age the wine, sometimes for many years, for it to be good, which is not true with most beers. Homebrewing has become popular probably because of these reasons. You can't just start making a top notch Merlot wine in your garage. So the investment and turnaround time to start a brewery I would assume is much less than starting a winery. 

Plus, beer has historically been much more popular with American drinkers than wine, and is significantly cheaper. So you'd think they're would be higher demand for beer variety than wine variety. 

Another factor for consumer demand is risk. You can buy a $15 bottle of beer and know with a great deal of certainty that it's going to be one of the best quality beers in the world. A $15 bottle of wine? It could just as easily taste terrible, and the same wine from the same winery can vary dramatically in quality from year to year. Unless a brewery changes up their recipe or starts cutting corners, the beer you like is going to stay pretty consistent year after year. As much as I love a good wine, I'd rather drop $15 on a drink I *know* is going to be good, instead of just guessing. 

So basically from an economic standpoint, from all the factors I've mentioned, it would make more sense for the two products to be switched- wine production being dominated by a few big producers and beer production being split among huge variety of small companies. Why is this not the case?

Would they prefer unemployment over a low paying job?

On the other hand, if they prefer taking up jobs which pay higher and for which they're also qualified, what's the harm in that? Are they really hurt by the low STEM wages at all, then? Who is getting hurt by this system, if at all?

I know there are some factors at play, such as temperature distribution, and efficiency, but how does it all practically play out?

For example, I brew beer and have a fridge that is half kegerator, half fermentation chamber. In the winter the fermentation chamber doesn't stay warm enough, so commonly people put in heaters. However, the divider is not perfect, so this will mean the fridge part will have to run a bit more to keep the kegerator part cool. In the summer, this would be a waste, as I'm trying to cool my house, but in the summer I don't need it anyway. In the winter, this will take extra electricity and turn it into heat in my home, but I'm heating my home anyway, so is it really ""wasteful""?"

8,0,"ELI5: I understand that the officer who put Eric Garner in a chokehold was not indicted for ""malicious intent,"" but what about unintentional homicide?","So, for obvious reasons, some people are more upset about the lack of an indictment in the Eric Garner case than the MB case (I am one of those people) because there is a video and less confusion about what actually occurred during the incident. I understand that the police officer who put Eric Garner in a chokehold most likely did not have the ""malicious intent"" to kill him, and that regardless, there was not enough evidence to say that he did. I am not a lawyer and was not present at the trial, so I am aware that I am not qualified to dispute this decision. What I don't understand, however, is why the police officer was not indicted or on trial for unintentional homicide or manslaughter. Is law enforcement protected from any accusations of unintentional killings? What if the victim was unarmed and/or not committing any clear crime (particularly one that wouldn't warrant any force)? Why is this man not being held accountable for killing a man who, if you watch the video, clearly did not need to be killed, whether or not he meant to do so? Drivers go to jail for killing people in car accidents even if it was unintentional. Is it not the same for police officers? I feel that those who are angry deserve justification as to why.

I see how if the civilian had people they knew who were in the civil services, presumably most people do, they could be reassured. I assume this is a rare occurrence and that most times the spooks pretend not to be spooks and make the person do stuff without having to convince them they are a spook.

But what if the person being approached knows no one like that. And for some reason it is necessary for the person to know they are working for the government. I assume that MI5 doesn't say to people ""come down to that big building by the river and have a chat in my office"" as presumably when you recruit someone you want to keep it secret.

Any information about you they showed you wouldn't prove anything much in these days. Police or hackers could know whatever they did.

I just cant imagine how if a spook wanted me to do something how the guy in front of me could convince me he was a spook, and not a conman/criminal or a police or a crazy person.

If went to a meeting deep in the aforementioned office, or if they demonstrated their powers over the police or the taxman to me I would be convinced. Kind of hoped I would be able to think of a more elegant answer but I cant. Can anyone else?"

Why?  It is especially frustrating when they are in left turn lane and take up most of that lane - preventing cars from getting into the turn lane - and then take so long to get through the green turn light that you miss the signal. 

Edit:  I am talking about a abnormally large cushion between cars. Conservatively a good driver would leave space between cars to avoid colliding with it if rear-ended or if the driver in front should roll back.  This is on flat ground and the space is unnecessarily large.  When the left turn lane is full it blocks traffic in the other lanes because people are waiting in the regular lane to get into the turn lane.  Plus, people who do this create additional unnecessary time which prevents long lines of traffic from getting through the green light before it changes to red."

0,0,ELI5: Why would it be a bad thing for local governments to build and offer their own high speed internet service?,"After hearing and loosely following what's been going on in Kansas, I'm trying to expand my understanding of the situation.

But I want to know if there is any downsides to this that I'm not aware of.  As I understand it, our economy is/was based on the free market and open competition;  so more competition would theoretically drive down prices, increase the quality of service.  In basic terms, if a service is offered by two companies (company A and company B), the logical choice would be to go with whichever company can offer the best value for the cheapest price.  So if company A can offer a service at several times the value of company B, how is this bad?  It would force company B to either increase the quality of their service to make them able to compete in the market, or they would have to leave the marketplace.  I guess I just don't get, logically, why broadband companies are fighting this so much.  I get why from the for-profit business side, but not from the logical side.

""A normal human sex drive presents an interesting opportunity to religion in that it is nearly universal and is a powerful driver of human behaviors. If a religion can associate these feelings with impurity, they can then point to these urges as demonstrating the need for the dogma on offer. In other words, if you have sexual thoughts, and those thoughts are associated with guilt and shame, it is evidence of your impure nature and your need to be saved. In essence, it is a means of manufacturing demand for the faith by convincing people they are deficient.
To pick on Christianity [sic] as an example, this is why priests and nuns must take vows of chastity. By abstaining from sex, they demonstrate purity, establishing themselves as figures of authority on matters of morality.""

I've actually had this question in my head for a long time, and when I saw this sub, I couldn't resist asking.

Alright, I know a bit of biology, so you can use some more complicated terms if you'd like. The biological sex of a fetus is determined by chromosomes, XX for girls and XY for boys. A woman's egg always carries an X chromosome, and a man's sperm can carry an X or a Y, which is what ultimately determines what the baby will become.

So several years ago when my sister-in-law became pregnant and I asked if I was getting a niece or nephew, I was surprised when my Mom said we wouldn't know until she was four or five months along. After all, once a sperm meets the egg, the gender has been decided, so they should know, right?

I can understand not knowing the gender from a home test or an early ultrasound, but it seems like blood tests could detect that, after all, they do tests sometimes to test for chromosomal defects.

So, TL;DR: Can a blood test determine the gender of a fetus before an ultrasound, or is that still in the realm of science fiction?

PS: For the curious, my sister-in-law had a boy. He's nine years old now. :)"

The next day I woke up thinking I had a concussion from a car crash I was in recently so I went to the doctor to get diagnosed with a concussion. The doctor thought I had meningitis so she sent me in an ambulance to the emergency room, they looked at my, tested my white blood cell count and determined I didn't have meningitis. They tested me for strep and mono, both came back negative. They sent me home with no medicine and told me I would get better and that I didn't have a concussion.
 9 days later my throat is still in just as much pain, same pain swallowing and still 
having trouble talking. I went to the doctor today under the assumption that I just needed antibiotics to get over this. It has only gotten worse over 10 days and I thought that antibiotics would be pretty reasonable. They just did another strep test and felt my spleen to determine I don't have mono, told me to take some Tylenol and that I should be fine by the weekend. I've only been getting worse for 10 days and they think I will be better be the weekend with Tylenol? This brings me to my question, why can't they just prescribe me antibiotics.

Obviously there are exceptions like Tesla Motors which went public despite telling shareholders they were long ways from profit, but that is a truly rare exception. So.. for example, I live in PA where we are blessed with an abundance of Wawa stores. it is a family owned private corporation that is doing extremely well financially. They have a vision and a mission and they go after it. Why would they ever go public and put investors above this vision? I get the whole capital injection aspect of it, but is there really a reason beyond this? If I ever have business and it's booming and growing like crazy, I will sure as hell keep it private so as not to jeopardize that what it took for it to become so booming in the first place."

8,0,ELI5: Why can the densities of supermassive black holes be less than that of water on earth and what does it mean?,"I understand that that the mathematics predict that the density is inversely proportional to the radius of the black hole itself 

**copied from wikipedia**

*First, the average density of a supermassive black hole (defined as the mass of the black hole divided by the volume within its Schwarzschild radius) can be less than the density of water in the case of some supermassive black holes.[5] This is because the Schwarzschild radius is directly proportional to mass, while density is inversely proportional to the volume. Since the volume of a spherical object (such as the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole) is directly proportional to the cube of the radius, the density of a black hole is inversely proportional to the square of the mass, and thus higher mass black holes have lower average density. In addition, the tidal forces in the vicinity of the event horizon are significantly weaker for massive black holes. As with density, the tidal force on a body at the event horizon is inversely proportional to the square of the mass: a person on the surface of the Earth and one at the event horizon of a 10 million solar mass black hole experience about the same tidal force between their head and feet. Unlike with stellar mass black holes, one would not experience significant tidal force until very deep into the black hole.*

If the allegations prove to be true, then the punishment should fit the crime if proven guilty.  However, my concern is that these allegations are anywhere from 10-50 years old (they seem to range from 1965 to 2004).  What's taken so long to come forward and start accusing Cosby, who is now 77 years old? Was it fear of retaliation, money previously paid off to the victims, traumatic stress, something else?

I only wonder for two reasons:

1) He's got one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel.  He's not exactly healthy, nor does he look like he'll live long enough to be able to adequately serve a sentence.  He's certainly got enough money to tie the case up in litigation until he's dead.

2) By now any statute of limitations will have passed, so he wouldn't be able to be tried for most of the older ones anyway.  My own brief research (and **please** correct me if I'm wrong) indicates very few states have no time limit on sexual assault, some go up to 12 years, but most seem to cap at 10 years.  Even still, the perpetrator must START the trial proceedings before the statute of limitation runs out.  Even the most recent accusations (2004) will run out by New Years Day if proceedings haven't begun yet.

Are they seriously looking for justice after so many years or are some of them just trying to get a piece of the pie before he croaks off?

It doesn't seem that complicated to me. Can't people just move into other neighborhoods that aren't as bad? 

Where I live, we have ghettos, but the cost to rent in those areas isn't that much lower than the ""trendy"" areas. In a lot of cases it's the same or even more expensive. Those areas seem to be 'ghettos' simply because the people who choose to live there are less fortunate.

I grew up in one of the worst neighborhoods in my city and as soon as I was living on my own, I found an apartment in an upper-class neighborhood for the same cost of living as the ghetto I lived in before.

e.g. If I paint an area yellow and then paint over it with black, the results will appear black(ish), but if I paint an area black and then try to paint it over with yellow, it will remain black(ish).

I  assume it has something to do with the materials or our eye and not the light itself because then I imagine things would get funky when considering the non-visible spectrum.

Can someone explain this to me like I am five (and then I can explain it to my kids)?

And if this is simply because of gravity/momentum at what elevation/distance would an object from earth have to be for the object to be able to be stationary while the earth spins at its equatorial speed below it.  And does the mass of that object effect how far it needs to be?

It seems in many of these cases where black men are shot, they all resist arrest, in some cases it is just the suspect refusing to comply to their commands/demands for answers that escalates into a confrontation.

correct me if I am wrong, but a suspect can remain silent, but they have to submit to arrest without resisting to do so.. I can see how black men then have to comply and will stay alive, but they refuse to answer AND copy with the police directions to stand still, show your hands, etc..

It is when men of any color refuse these types of directions that instantly flips to resisting arrest, especially once the police put their hands on you and you try to flee or wiggle lose..

We need Public Service Announcements that play across the nation showing the proper way to respond to police, and how to stay alive. Highlight what not to do, just like drinking and driving in the 1970s, the PSA through-out the 80s drastically cut down the number of deaths a year due to alcohol and driving.

Today in my health class we had to watch a video of a woman giving birth, my health teacher said they watched the same one when he was he in high school at a different school, and I have cousins and friends who watched it at their various schools, so it's clearly very common.

We saw her vagina etc., while she was in labor. It was disgusting to say the least and I don't think I ever want to have babies after seeing that video. 

But we didn't need any kind of parental permission to watch that video. We just showed up and the teacher played it. However, this week in my Spanish class we watched the movie Volver. There's no nudity or violence and very little swearing. It's rated R for 'adult themes' because the protagonist gets raped. We needed permission to watch that.

Also bare in mind, even the adult themes thing makes no sense. We talk about rape is History, read about it in English, and talk about it in Health. Why is it okay in some contexts, but not others?

They killed a Russian hostage very early on because he was completely unmarketable, no way Russia was going to pay the ransom, so they just killed him. So ISIS basically collected prisoners from all over the place, gathered them in one place with the intent of maximizing their earnings/media exposure. Then we go in with Navy Seals to try to rescue the Americans like gung ho heroes because they've encouraged this ""we're not just in it for the money"" Jihad narrative, when they are so totally just in it for the money. The hostages from countries that were planning to pay the ransom are then put at risk during these American rescue missions, when before they would have survived just by virtue of their government valuing their lives enough to simply shell out the money and get their citizen to safety before firing back. I just don't get why it has to be so zero tolerance when if the US had simply paid the ransom some of these hostages would probably be alive and with their families right now.

How does the size (lets say the creature is of average mammal density, and doesn't have hollow bones like birds) relate to how much wingspan it needs to get off the ground.      
        
(I recognise that actually generating enough energy to move such wings and get an average weight human off the ground would be near impossible for a human metabolism - but humour me :) )"

A person drinks to get over depression. (S)he consumes enough alcohol that the next day, they feel depressed, even perhaps when he or she normally doesn't, so he/she drinks more alcohol to get over the depression.

The next day, more depression, more alcohol.

Then more depression caused by more alcohol, and more alcohol caused by more depression.

Is this a completely unavoidable situation?

I'll be completely honest as to why I'm asking-- I'm an inexperienced drinker and last night I bought a bottle of Smirnoff Ice (1 pint 6 oz or 650mL, only like 4.5% ABV) and drank about half of it. Made me feel kinda good, but I wasn't drunk or even close to it. Just buzzed, and barely tbqh.

Then today, I'm kinda bleh (no hangover, no headache, just kinda low). So my first instinct-- ""Maybe I should have a drink again.""

But then I fear that the cycle I described above might start. Am I always going to feel depressed the next day every time I get buzzed? Or is there a way to keep that from happening?"

i've noticed that Japan likes to sweep victims under the rug or even outright blame them for reasons i can only assume are cultural. granted, most of the stuff i remember about the subject are from factually questionable websites like [TV Tropes's Values Dissonance page](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ValuesDissonance/Anime) (doesn't cite sources), Sankaku Complex (doesn't cite sources and they would much rather post articles about anime tits and bashing China anyways), /r/anime (fictional, but the underlying theme is still there) and a few other sites i can't remember and really wish i bookmarked...

some examples i can remember off the top of my head:

* Hikkikomori (basically, shut-ins) tend to not get the help they need to get out of their slump and parents just pretend their problem child doesn't exist

* Women who are molested on trains get their own women-only train car instead of actually addressing the molesting problem

* i vaguely remember reading about people who survived the Hiroshima bombing getting shunned, and a similar case with people who survived the Fukushima nuclear disaster

* an anime called Sword Art Online^( please don't kill me /r/anime) features a character who saved her mother and a bank teller from an armed robber by taking his gun and shooting him dead and gets socially outcast for her troubles, and another character who was shunned most of her childhood for having AIDS. i've seen at least one comment on that subreddit questioning the backwards thinking so at least i'm not the only one wondering about this.

* a quick Google search for ""japan victim blaming"" (without quotes) gives me [this article](http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Japan/EG15Dh03.html) for the first result, which is about a comic store owner who was robbed and then perplexingly blamed for the death of the robber after he tried running from the cops and subsequently run over by a train

i just want to know why Japan seems quick to the draw to shift blame to the victims, or even if this is a widespread issue to begin with and the websites i've read are just blowing it out of proportion. i guess my Google-fu is weak because i've never been able to find out whatever underlying cultural norm from centuries past perpetuates this behavior."

At OU the situation seems similar. The grads get an education and in return they teach some classes. As I understand it these are not folks who have already earned advanced degrees and are adjuncts. I guess I don't understand why they expect more. Seems like a pretty solid trade.

I'll include that I'm pro-union and usually line up on the labor side of things but am at a loss here. Universities aren't businesses and these guys are getting an education.

1,0,ELI5: Why the IRS allows $0.56/mile deductions regardless of vehicle value,"I don't really get the practice of allowing business owners to deduct a standard mileage rate regardless of value. 

Example: I have a friend who owns vehicles for business. He buys used vans for around $8k with 100k miles on them. If he puts 20k miles on them in a year, he gets to deduct 11k from his taxes. 

Since vans can easily run for 180k miles. He can continue to put these miles on for 4 more years. Getting 44k dollars in tax deductions for a vehicle he spent 8k on. If you have two business vehicles it adds up even faster.

I understand that some portion of the $0.56 goes to gas and repairs, but this does not account for this large overage  and insurance is separate. 

He essentially pays no income tax, qualifies for free government services like healthcare and food stamps, and pays no tax. All while making more money than most middle class families. It seems bizarre to me.

**Edit: The answer seems to be that the mileage of the vehicle (10mpg = 0.30/mile) affects things greatly.**

Devil's Breath is a drug, mostly found in Columbia, that can be used to take away someone's free will, among many other things. With the correct dosage, it can cause someone to bend to demands of another person and has been used in the past for truth serum.

1,0,ELI5: What's the point of enforcing that short barreled rifles and shotguns need to be registered under the National Firearms Act in the United States?,"The National Firearms Act required that a person needs to register the firearm with the BATFE and obtain a $200 tax stamp before they can own or create a rifle or shotgun with a barrel less then 16 inches or 24 inches, respectively. Failure to do so can lead to fines and a felony conviction. 

The issue is that it's entirely possible to obtain AR and AK variants that are classified as pistols with really short barrels and no stocks without the extra paperwork, and you can obtain a pistol brace (http://truthaboutguns-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/brace-1.jpg) that doesn't change the classification of the pistol into an SBR and, for now, is legal to shoulder like a rifle. For shotguns there exists bullpup designs like the Kel-Tec KSG that keep the proper barrel length while offering a compact package.

The overall concealability of these firearms is questionable in many circumstances, and while I am aware of instances where rifle caliber pistols have been used in crime, it's not the norm due to their bulkiness. Does enforcing the NFA on these products curve crime at all or is it pointless considering the many studies showing that small caliber handguns are the weapon of choice for criminals?

(Disclaimer: I am currently of the opinion that SBRs/SBS and suppressors should be excluded from the NFA and machine guns remain, with the latter having the registry for new MGs reopened after being shut in 1986. If sources are requested for some of my comments I will try to oblige, please do not call my comments out as conjecture.)"

Math and physics interest me so much more than English, yet I am not nearly as skilled in advanced mathematics. I want to increase my mathematical knowledge, but it seems that it just doesn't come as easy as English. Unfortunately Google results in a large number of what I would consider unscientific research into this matter, so I thought ""why not ask Reddit""?

Can you genuinely increase your intelligence due to the neuroplasticity of the brain or do you just have to work with what you have? Am I forever doomed to have to work harder at mathematics than those who seem to have it come naturally? Will studying math, or any other subject matter, increase my IQ or ease of understanding in that subject? I assume we simply don't know enough about the brain for that question to be accurately answered, but I thought I would ask anyway. I know of many different resources online that supposedly increase your intelligence, but I have no clue as to their scientific merit.

tl;dr - Is it possible to increase your IQ through mental exercises or studying, or does your intelligence remain static while your knowledge is dynamic?

That is, had they known about the cancer when it was still very small with little growth, they could have got rid of it then and there.

0,0,ELI5: Why is CSV data not suggested for databases?,"I know about first normal form, any data in a database should be indivisible for easier joins, indexing, etc. But what if a database element doesn't benefit from being divided?

Say I categorize users by a set of flags concatenated in a string for insertion into a database. These are in the form *###*. Admins might have flags *111*, important users *011*, other users *001*, guests *000*. Under 1NF, it claims to be advantageous to create a new table with columns *userid*, *flag1*, *flag2*, *flag3*, but this would require a table join or sending a request to a new table when the first table is already indexed. Here's example code for each method:

    $getUser = $db-&gt;prepare(""
        SELECT flags
            FROM users
            WHERE userid = :someval
    "");
    $getUser-&gt;execute(array(
        ':someval' =&gt; $someval
    ));
    $flagarray = explode("""",$getUser-&gt;fetchColumn());
    //$flagarray[0], $flagarray[1], etc can now be indexed

versus...

    $getUser = $db-&gt;prepare(""
        SELECT f.flag1, f.flag2, f.flag3
            FROM users u
            LEFT JOIN userflags f
                ON u.userid = f.userid
            WHERE u.userid = :someval
    "");
    $getUser-&gt;execute(array(
        ':someval' =&gt; $someval
    ));
    $flagarray = $getUser-&gt;fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
    //$flagarray[0], $flagarray[1], etc can now be indexed

Provided there is only one instance where flags even need to be instanced, it seems **more efficient** to use the first method, using CSV. This is bad practice, but why?

**edit;** I know my example is a poor one. I could just have flags as a single-digit integer (1, 2, 3, etc) but assume there's more flag profiles than the ones I've mentioned."

Same with the rabbits.

I don't get it.  If they ""like"" being held, why run away in the first place?  If they don't like being held, why stop struggling once I'm holding them?  It's just weird.  Do completely wild versions of these animals stop struggling when you hold them snugly or do they keep struggling?

*Most people want to leave the city, only a few want to go into it -- so dedicate 8 lanes to outbound traffic and 2 lanes to inbound traffic.*

What I mean is that if an individual is only looking out for him/herself, in many cases a small/familial group would stop tolerating that particular behavior in favor the benefit of the group.

I work in a city that's populated by wealthy families that average well above 100K a year and pass through many cities like that on my commute to work.

Where I live, I notice that the drivers are less aggressive and less competent than the ones in the wealthier areas.  I don't have detailed data to draw a statistically significant conclusion like that but it's just my observation over the years.  For example, I see these more often near where I live than the wealthier areas:

- People who have trouble backing out of parking spaces usually taking 2-3 times the amount of time than usual.

- People who insist on yielding to you when it's clear they have the right of way.

- People who drive well below the speed limit in broad daylight and perfect weather.

- People react much slower whenever the light turns green at intersections.

Some of what I describe above may pertain to older drivers..  but I don't think the general population where I live is older than the surrounding areas..  just a little less wealthy but probably still lower middle class.

1. I understand the mouth piece needs a small hole but why?

2. How does the sound hole size effect the whistle so much? Seems like if it is too big or too small I get nothing

3. When doing a whistle flute how does finger hole size and placement work? Exactly why does the closer hole when open make a different noise then the last hole?

4. Does length for the whistle flute and width play a part and if so what? I tried a whistle flute and the bamboo I am using has an opening about a quarter inch in diameter and was a few inches long. I got no sound at all so I cut it short and made just a whistle from it and it made sound. Why was it not making sound when longer? Do I need thicker bamboo?

Here's what I need more help with:
Is N. Ireland indeed a country? Will I get a different answer depending on whom I'm asking?

Is one area more or less friendly to Americans? It stands to reason that Loyalists would have a proxy-grudge against us for our allegiance to the UK.  

Are Ireland and N. Ireland represented in the UK Parliament?

Can citizens of the island of Ireland travel freely between N. Ireland and Ireland?

Hey redditors, I've been watching videos of people generating electricity with solar, wind and water. I read a book (half way and about two years ago on a road trip) about the fundamentals of electricity. Wattage, amperage and how electricity works are what was covered in the section I read.

I suppose I jumped into more advanced material without truly understanding how it works to build my own small generators. I am hoping someone on here can explain it in a manner that clicks. I want to build a small, self producing generator for water that could power its own pump and hopefully produce more than it consumes. An awesome follow up, what type of batteries are best to store the power generated? Most common seemed to be car batteries.
Thanks redditors, I await your intelligence!"

It has been pretty much the same for over 500 years, and has been around far longer than that, in slightly different shapes and forms.

However among good players, most games end in a stalemate - and white is playing to win while black is normally playing to draw.

Additionally the first few moves of chess can be pretty much played out of a book ie. the opening is set to a few possibilities, then the game opens up to something different.

I would have thought that people would have tweaked and balanced it over the years, to improve the game - and that has happened, but none of the variants are even modestly popular compared to the original.

Also I would think that a more balanced, deeper and more strategic board came could have been developed by now, and again, they probably have, but none are anywhere near as popular.

So why do we still play the same 500 year old game?"

A couple of defectives are being purchased and resold by independent sellers on Ebay for $25,000, as shown by the legless peach amiibo. The profit from that is HUGE, a 193076% increase in profit. 

My question is, Why doesn't Nintendo try and catch some of this profit by producing special defectives and allowing biddings on the few, special products? Is it just against their business model? As a company, are they just not realizing this potential value of their amiibos?

[Here it is](http://www.enviromagnetics.net/) for the curious. Basically these guys sell 2 magnets and 2 zip ties claiming that if you attach them to  your fuel line and air intake it will ""energize and stabilize"" them and increase your MPG by up to 42%, and they guarantee savings of AT LEAST 20%. They even provided a table with ""Fuel Tests"" for different vehicle makes and models. They also sell same, different colored kits to attach to garden hoses to increase your yield, pool filters to reduce risk of cancer from chlorine, you name it. They have fake pictures of ""fuel combustion"" before and after applying their devices. Here's a quote from their website on the ""break-in period""

&gt; Note on emissions testing and Stabilization Period:
Once the GSS is installed, depending upon your city / highway mix of driving, it takes on average 2 - 5 tanks of fuel to stabilize the engine and the computer to the higher octane of the treated fuel. Your engines economy may start to climb, but once the system and computer stabilizes, your economy will suddenly jump and the engine will start saving. 
We fully guarantee that you will be 100% satisfied with your savings or your money back. 
-Sincerely, Peter Kulish

This is obviously bogus as attaching magnets to your fuel line will not increase fuels octane rating by slightest, and even if there was a clamp-on device that did that - higher octane will not give you increase in MPG or power. Higher octane fuel is harder to ignite and is made for engines with higher compression (sports/racing cars) to prevent premature ignition, not give MPG savings. 

My question is how is this not against the law? Isn't this considered false advertising? I understand the twist-tube butter stick that is HeadOn could get away with this because they didn't really claim that their product did anything (except that you should apply it directly to forehead), but these guys are straight up lying about their product with fake tests, images, and probably bogus guarantee.

1,0,ELI5: Tax Protesters and the controversy over the federal income tax.,"From Wikipedia:
&gt;Arguments made by tax protesters in the United States generally fall into several categories: that the Sixteenth Amendment was never properly ratified; that the Sixteenth Amendment does not permit the taxation of individual income, or particular forms of individual income; that other provisions of the Constitution such as the First, Fifth, or a ""Missing Thirteenth Amendment"" eliminate an obligation to file a return; that citizens of the states are not also citizens of the United States; that the statutes enacted by the United States Congress pursuant to their constitutional taxing power are defective or invalid; that the tax code does not apply to inhabitants of U.S. territories; and that the government and the courts engage in various conspiracies to conceal the above deficiencies. Outside of the United States, tax protesters raise similar conspiracy arguments, claims that they are not ""citizens"" under the jurisdiction of the court where the claim is brought, and claims about the validity of statutes imposing taxation.

It seems to me from what I've found that the 16th amendment was in fact ratified by enough states to pass into law, even if Ohio isn't counted, three more ratified it soon after the prerequisite number was reached. (Argument 1)

Also, the amendment says
&gt;The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from **whatever source derived**, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.
(Argument 2, 3, 4, and 5)

The supreme court made a decision making it illegal for someone to willfully neglect to file income tax returns. Therefore you are required by this decision to file a tax return, barring you live under a cave and have never worked a day in your life and realized taxes exist. [see here](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/274/259/)

From what I understand, smoking isn't exactly great for one's skin: risk of premature aging amongst other things. So, why risk your looks when your business is all about them?


Either this isn't as as big of a deal as I assumed (plus models and actors probably start off with especially good genetics), or they are willing to take the risk for a particular reason. For example, models need to stay thin. Maybe the effect smoking on curbing appetite is greater than the risk of a wrinkle, which can be masked with makeup or photoshop. Another example, when looking at Kate Moss, her skin isn't great. It is interesting that she would risk her looks like that, especially since she isn't quite retired from modeling yet.

3,0,ELI5: Why is the Amazon rainforest so important to earth?,"This may be the dumbest question ever, but while stoned and reading an article the other day my brain wondered...

I understand it produces something like 20% of the earths oxygen - that being said - does the oxygen provided by the amazon spread all over earth - is it used equally by every one and everything that requires oxygen? 

 and I know there are a lot of species living in the rainforest - which of those species would be detrimental to earth (straw that breaks the camels back) if lost.

Thanks

Is this due to the difference in food? Wet cat food looks and smells quite different (and greasier) than wet dog food, but both animals can be fed dry food which seems more similar. And if meat in general is the cause for the rancidness coming out of both species, how come when I went 3 days eating nothing but steak, shredded beef, and some chicken, I didn't gas anyone out or blow up the bathroom (I swear to god, was dreading that but it really wasn't that bad at all)?"

Because for example let's say you want to write 1/3 of a meter decimal, that's 0,333 (and a ""infinite"" amount of more 3's). Let's call the number 0,33....33 ""N"". So eventually N has so incredibly many 3's. A huge amount but not infinite, you have so incredibly many 3's that it doesn't matter what you use it for our number N isn't infinite it still isn't quite N=1/3 but it's so incredibly close that it doesn't matter at all. How can that number ever be infinite if there's 1. Nothing to apply it to if you use it for length it will be as precise as 1/3 even by a molecule because N is so incredibly close to 1/3. And 2. How can it even be possible that number ever ends? Eventually there HAS to be a point where it doesn't matter anymore where it's precise.

TL;DR: How can things be infinite if it eventually gets so big and precise that it doesn't matter if you add another number, because it goes so far that it doesn't make a difference.

I asked what her accent sounded like in Spanish. She said it was Chilean. I asked why it wasn't American? She said you can always tell an American who learned Spanish, just like you can tell a German from a French speaker who learns English.

But that wasn't exactly what I meant. There are British, Australian, Canadian, American (and more, obviously) accents, as well as regional accents within those larger groups. And I know a Spaniard sounds different from a Mexican or an Ecuadoran. 

Given how many native Spanish speakers there are in the US, I was surprised that there isn't an American accent *among native Spanish speakers*. My friend says, Nope, first generation kids like her take the accent of her parents.

There isn't a linear relationship between labour costs, the benefit of that labour, and the number of people doing that work.

Edit2: Mostly explained, assuming this is looked at from a capitalist perspective. The responses do feel unsatisfying from a ""let's give a shit about other humans since we have the means to"" point of view. 

Edit3: those of you still adding answers, the ""what is a living wage"" thing has been beaten to death and is sort of irrelevant since that could be calculated later. This is more of a, from a government perspective, why would someone legislate a minimum wage which is not a living wage for a full time employee?"

It doesn't make sense to me because cars are big ticket items that cost thousands and thousands of dollars, and on a purchase that large I wouldn't think a commercial could influence people enough to make the money spent on the advertising worthwhile.

I feel like commercials would work better for everyday items (food, clothes, toiletries, etc) because they are cheap enough that they can be impulse buys, and the advertising could be almost immediately effective. For example, if you see a commercial for a tasty looking burger, you might stop into Mc Donald's on your way home and get that burger. Car commercials wouldn't have the same effect, so I'm just curious as to what their purpose is."

1,0,ELI5: Bedding's Thread Count measured per cm2?,"I'm from Russia and recently I decided to figure out bedding and get myself a good set of bed sheets. 

Majority of Russian stores don't know about thread count and majority of bed sheets sold do not have it on the sticker or anywhere. But we also have only one term for ""satin"" and it's treated like a fabric type, so you'll often have ""cotton"" and ""satin"" as two different, sometimes exclusive options when choosing fabric type... Yeah, it's that retarded...

Now, those more expensive shops that do know about it (Togas, Hastens, Finnlayson) all told me numbers like 200, 300.... except, per cm2. Now, from what I understand, that's a mistake, because TC is measured per inch2, not cm2. If a world-known company like Togas or Finnlayson or Hastens would make sheets with, say, 300 per cm2, it would be either 762 TC or 1935 TC, depending on wether it actually counts threads both ways (horizontal and vertical) or not, either way, this uneven number would look strange to european/american customers.

Hastens looks like most well known brand, but I couldn't find any information about their TC except one ""custom form pillow"" that has 300 TC. And I was told in the shop today that they have sateen which has 200 and 300 threads per cm2... 

So can I assume they just don't understand what they're talking about, and really they are telling me the TC of the fabric (measured per inch), but mistakenly say it's per cm2? Or can it be these are really per cm2? Does this mean then that 220 per cm2 is better than 400 TC?

PS: Side question, Hastens is supposed to be like a badass bedding store, with one set of bed linen costing like a cheap car... Why do they only have 300 TC max then? Is 400 or 600 TC really not worth it?"

I don't believe in right or wrong. I just don't understand how we decide what is what. Obviously, I get good and bad: good is beneficial, bad is detrimental. So, when we say drugs are bad, we're saying they are detrimental to our health.

Morality doesn't seem quite so clean cut, though. Rape is beneficial to me, because I get what I want, but detrimental to the raped. Same can be said for stealing and killing. What makes these things ""wrong?"" Is it a social construct? Like, did we all agree to say it's wrong so that we're at lesser risk to be raped and stuff? If so, why do people get so emotional about it? And why do people thinks gays and interracial marriage are wrong, if they're not bad for anyone?

I just don't get how this works. Also, if someone could explain guilt, that would be great. I don't get that, either. If you got away with something, and society is still keeping you safe and such, why would you feel bad? Didn't you just beat the system?"

For example, Youtube uses the Content ID platform for rights holders to manage their content. If a video is flagged, fair use or not, it's then up to the uploader to make a dispute. This essentially puts the burden of proof on the uploader and allows rights holders to abuse the system without much consequence (see: any video taken down even though it complies with fair use and/or is public domain).

0,0,ELI5: Time travel/parallel tangent theory,"I'm working on a plot for a new movie/video project that involves time travel and a ""parallel tangent theory"" concept, and I need help with the following situation:

The idea I have come up with is that there is an alternate universe for every choice you make - say that you are given a decision to flip a coin, and a separate multiverse (which I call a ""Tangent"") develops from the chance. in one universe, it lands heads, and in the other, it lands tails. This has been going on since the beginning of time, and there are insurmountable separate universes in which different decisions were made.

The plot takes place in two min time periods: 2015 and 1997. A high-school student named Raymond invents a 'time machine' which enables him to go back to the year 1997 (ignore the fact that it is impossible for a high-school student to invent a time machine; it's space time continuum that I'm worried about here and not the inventing abilities of teenagers). Let's call 1997 ""U"", or the Ultimatum from which the Tangents stem. He goes back to 1997, and while in a restaurant, he accidentally causes a bottle of milk to spill. Fearing the butterfly effect (which is where if you alter the past, the future changes), he travels back to the future, and finds that his best friend is gone, having never existed. 

In reality, with my theory, he didn't really change his own past (or from the point of view of 1997, a new future) - he merely invented a new one with his creating of a new Tangent. The timeline in which he grew up is called ""Tangent I"" and the new one he created from spilling the milk is called ""Tangent II"". He traveled forwards in time to Tangent II when he spilled the milk in the Ultimatum from which both Tangents stem. Eventually what happens is, be goes back to the Ultimatum of 1997, and realizes that if he 'meets himself' in the past, then a paradox would be created and BOOM - the space-time continuum would collapse in on itself (at the very least in that Tangent; either way he would probably die). 

He eventually travels down two more Tangents (""III"" and ""IV""). In Tangent III, his best friend (we'll call her Margo) is completely different, and she's now a overemotional bully, and he is supposedly a quiet, Goth loner. He realizes that the butterfly effect couldn't have happened because if there was a single timeline, then he himself will have died already because the time machine would have never happened. He comes up with the whole alternate-Tangents-Ultimatum theory, and goes back to 1997 again, and as an experiment, changes a little thing in the best and goes into the future again along Tangent IV. In Tangent IV, Margo is a stereotypical science geek, like him, and he himself never existed, so he is safe from self-corruption in this Tangent. 

Think of it like this diagram, which I hope will explain better:

   U (Ultimatum, 1997)
   stems to
   M, which stems to A + B
   and also stems to 
   T, which stems to A"" + B""
   M is in which Raymond never went into the past
   T is where Raymond has previously meddled in the past
   MA, in which there is no meddling by Raymond, yields Tangent I.
   MB, in which he spills the milk, yields Tangent II.
   TA"", in which he goes to realize there are different outcomes possible yields Tangent III.
   TB"", in which he experiments to prove himself right, yields Tangent IV.

What I need help with is the idea I had for an ending - since the different Tangents coexist together in the alternate Tangent theory, the original Tangent, Tangent I, must still exist. He tries to find a way to get back to Tangent I from Tangent IV with the help of Tangent IV's version of Margo.

So, with this whole theory in mind, is it possible for him to travel in between Tangents coherently? Because I want the story to end with him ending up back in Tangent I, and I want it to at least try to be scientifically accurate. If it's not possible, I'll simply use creative license. If there's any discrepancy in the above explanation, or if there's something I forgot, I'll edit it later.

Thanks for your help!

&gt; 
&gt; Two sources told Recode that Sony is using hundreds of computers in Asia to perform distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attacks on sites that are hosting exposed files from the original hack. But apparently this isn’t happening in a sketchy warehouse somewhere—sources say that Sony is working with Amazon Web Services (Amazon’s cloud service) to launch the counterattacks. 
&gt; 
&gt; The hackers who infiltrated Sony Pictures, known as “Guardians of the Peace,” have released five troves of Sony data over the past few weeks. The company’s countermeasure involves overwhelming torrenters with network requests if they attempt to download files from the leak.
&gt; 
&gt; Sony used to use a similar approach in the early 2000s, when illegal file sharing exploded. Sony would plant fake torrent “seeds” on popular sites, and when someone tried to use them, the download would take hours, be extremely processor-intensive, and yield ... nothing. Sony developed the strategy with anti-piracy firm MediaDefender, and the idea was to make the experience painful enough for torrenters that they would want to avoid it in the future by purchasing legitimate media."

So first of all I live in Michigan and on a popular news source (Mlive) they had a story on a woman who's not vaccinating her children due to ""compromised"" immune systems. After reading the comment arguments for both sides I'm lost... most say it's a self diagnosed issue and the mother is dumb. The other stand is ""if your vaccinated what do you have to worry about? Her kids her choice deal with it!""

That's what I know but here's what i want to know...

Wtf is a compromised immune system? is it a legitimate argument against vaccines or some hocus pokus media made fear?

Also, let's say half of the kids at my son's school are and the other half aren't vaccinated... my kid is. What are the chances of him catching something if there's a breakout of let's say, polio, on the non vaxed kids, that he catches it?

This has been something I haven't given much attention to because I always thought, ""family is vaxed so who cares?""

0,0,ELI5: Why does eating the same food too often eventually make it repulsive?,"A while ago, I was eating chili rianos regularly. I must have eaten one every other day, if not more often. I just liked them a lot so I kinda kept hitting up the same Mexican restaurant and taking them home.

One day, I went in as usual, got one, opened it up, and just felt absolutely repulsed at the idea of eating it. I couldn't stomach more than a couple of bites before giving the rest to my girlfriend. It's been about a year since this and I feel as if I'll never want one again.

How does this happen? Obviously if the food is nurturing us and is delicious at one point, it would make sense that nothing about that changes, but to take such a complete 180 in my desire to eat this food is just strange to me."

2586,0,ELI5: Why is the CIA allowed to black out parts of declassified documents?,"Initially I thought it was just to protect the names of specific people involved - and indeed, that is definitely one reason they do this - but sometimes in declassified documents you'll see entire sentences or even paragraphs blacked out completely. I know it's the government, not just the CIA, who decides what gets declassified, but what's the point of declassifying a document if the CIA first gets to cover up the most sensitive bits? In the case of particularly damning documents, such the recent torture pieces, what's stopping them from simply blacking out the entire document? Do we know anything about the type of information that normally gets covered up? Is there *any* policy on this, or does the CIA just kind of do it and expect people to deal with it? Is it even carried out by the CIA in the first place, or is somebody else in charge of this?

I've been wondering this ever since I saw an old document about Charlie Chaplin in the communism witch hunts, where nearly full pages of the document had been removed despite it being a supposedly well-known and well-publicized scenario. It seems more relevant now than ever, though, as the torture documents have similar censorship and this is extremely unnerving for such an already controversial release.

EDIT: Thanks, everyone. The answers explained the law in place to determine what should and shouldn't be blacked out, and shed some light on the process and who's responsible for it. A lot of the info on what actually gets cut is still fuzzy, but that seems natural considering nobody can actually know exactly what that info used to be.

EDIT 2: Even the information on what's actually cut seems pretty clear now, or at least the type of thing they normally remove. I marked this explained a while ago but the explanations that are still coming in have been very helpful too. Thank you.

Apparently about [200 million people download YouTube videos](http://www.ibtimes.com/downloading-music-youtube-legal-best-youtube-mp3-converter-sites-are-often-shut-down-799693).

In the long run it would seem to me like if you can download from YouTube you will be coming back for more content later, and if that content is good you will be watching more of the content owners videos which results in more ad revenue. So why not keep people on the site instead of going to third party sites to download?

Technically I don't see any way to prevent downloads. You can always use screen capturing in the end, downloading sites are just a convenience.

There must be a business reason why disallowing downloads makes sense however I cannot find any logic in it. Can somebody with more knowledge about these issues shed a light on this?

        ""I, _____ do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God.""
     

   
When I Read up this oath is a Reference back to Americas First Oath;
         The first oath, voted on 14 June 1775 as part of the act creating the Continental Army, read:

         ""I _____ have, this day, voluntarily enlisted myself, as a soldier, in the American continental army, for one year, unless sooner discharged: And I do bind myself to conform, in all instances, to such rules and regulations, as are, or shall be, established for the government of the said Army.""
       

Then the original wording was effectively replaced by Section 3, Article 1, of the Articles of War approved by Congress on 20 September 1776, which specified that the oath of enlistment read: 

         ""I _____ swear (or affirm as the case may be) to be trued to the United States of America, and to serve them honestly and faithfully against all their enemies opposers whatsoever; and to observe and obey the orders of the Continental Congress, and the orders of the Generals and officers set over me by them.""
        
This version remained in effect until 1830 with adoption of the present wording. Why were the the Congressional powers stripped and given to the POTUS, as to whom they are to obey the orders of?



TL/DR: in 1830 the Oath of Enlistment changed from swearing to take orders from Congress to the POTUS, Why?"

So my question is at what point does a doctor ""decide"" that a patient will not recover and focus instead on harvesting organs? If someone is say, bleeding out, and will MOST LIKELY due but COULD be saved will a doctor keep trying to save him or will he just say it's not worth it and save the organs while they're still good? Are organs still ""good"" after the person is dead and the heart stops beating, or do they have to be taken out while the person is still technically alive?

I'm currently listed as an organ donor because obviously I don't need them if I'm dead, but I'm curious if I'm in a terrible accident or something if I'll end up being the priority or if my organs will."

7,0,ELI5: Why are children such assholes?,"Recently read this from one of the top posts of all time:

&gt;Buried comment, but here goes. Not life ruining but makes me feel like shit every time I think about it. As I've told Reddit before, I have a blind brother. When we were young, I used to get so frustrated at all the extra attention he received and how I had to be more responsible with my sibling than my peers. So, when my brother and I would go play, go to the store, or just generally go anywhere without adults, I would abandon him somewhere unfamiliar to him. Then, I would stand off quietly and watch the anxiety set in as he tried to figure out where he was and what was going on.
Also, I was really intelligent as a child and knew that was my ticket to attention. When I would ""help"" my brother with his homework, I would teach him all the wrong answers, so that I could continue being the smarter sibling. Today, my brother is my best friend. He goes to college and lives by himself. He's become one of the most intelligent men I've ever met. I'm trying to make it up to him now by being the best big sister ever, but I still feel so guilty at how I found him to be a burden when I was a kid.

One of the cruellest things i have ever read, and while this may be a specific case, why is cruelty in children so prevalent?"

I was researching and the difference apparently is that ""torture causes long-term irriversable physical or mental harm"" whereas the tactics they were using were did not have long-term effects, were in a controlled enviornment, and they even used on their own men.

But I was talking about technology with someone on /r/AskSocialScience, got lost in thought, and began asking myself the following questions: why do you want to go to the Moon anyway? What is that meant to accomplish, apart from the fact that you put a man on the Moon?

It's accepted knowledge that building a spaceship that successfully lands someone on the Moon is a massive accomplishment, and by that we automatically assume that the endeavor was worthwhile in and of itself (perhaps because of the massive value we, as a society, give science and technology).

Now, I completely understand the value of doing it once: you get to collect samples, take some sick pics, and you get to say that humanity has finally left the planet (although the reason why we need to leave the planet remains unexplained, at least to me - it really seems like a case of ""if you can, you should""). But how about every subsequent trip? What was the point of those? What was accomplished? Was it done to stick it to the Russians?

For instance, I have some idea about why Jewish people are influential in banking, but wasn't entirely positive about it. Back in the days the business of lending money was considered to be unchristian that's why Jews during those times were prominent in that business. Centuries of that would of course set their influence over the whole banking industry in Europe and in regard to the US, you could only become a bank if you have some money to begin with.

This I thought provided them the means to simply pop up once again whenever they were taken down and also meant that if they were raided anywhere they has the means to start up again from elsewhere already in place.

I also read [this](http://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-runs-on-21-raid-proof-virtual-machines-140921/) which seemed to provide a laymen's understanding of how they went about doing exactly what I just described. How then is it anyone was able to raid them and 'seemingly' be effective in taking them down this way. Why didn't anyone just do this before for that matter? I mean it happened back when it was under its original ownership and it did nothing to stop them.

EDIT: After reading the responses and the other similar thread linked to in the comments I think the short answer is nobody knows which unsurprisingly is probably why none of the relevant tech media have offered up any articles answering this question themselves. I figured this may have been the case, but I did wonder if there was any very savvy and informed guesses that could offer an interesting theoretical answer, howeve it seems no amount of nouse can penetrate this fog because the relevant details of how are likely being kept close to the chests of the authorities and the website owners for now. 

I think personally, my theory for now is one I entertained to begin with which is that the owners simply hadn't implemented the type of raid proof architecture they spoke of previously at all, at least not close to the extent they may have described. In this theory, there is no special trick or tactics employed by authorities or vulnerability to the the way tpb theoretically set things up, just human frailty and a case of grandiose claims being found to be false. I don't find this particularly unlikely, they've previously talked about running servers from drones and moving to Sealand, or North Korea. Whatever the case, I'll miss them, they were a great symbol even if what they became since ownership from the founders was transferred, was perhaps something less than what they could have been.

The load balancer theory holds some weight on further re-reading of my source article, as it sounds like that was running through just the one virtual machine. But it seems that though the load balancer was a possible single point of failure for the operation it doesn't sound as though it should have made it impossible to simply start up a new one again (especially as they wouldn't have been out of pocket for the actual machinery) given the various other VMs for the operation should have still operated (or at least many of them) and it sounds like most of the other functions of the site which were catered to by specific VM's actually had redundancy (the article implies the load balancer didn't). This suggests then that if the measures they claimed to have taken had been taken, then the reason tpb isn't back up yet is because those who could put it back up, aren't for one reason or another.

So I sit him up and lean him against a cabinet all the while trying not to make a huge scene because (don't ask me why, I should have called for our nurse that works here in the building from the start) I get him up and of course his head falls to his chest I lift up his glasses to check his eyes and they've already rolled back into his head but there was slight movement in them that I could see.. A good sign. So i go in for the pulse.. His heart is still beating. Thank god. His breathing was too faint for me to notice. But we're not out of the woods yet, this dude is honestly on his way to dieing. So I get him off the ground and up into his chair. (Have you ever tried to pick up a lifeless or near lifeless body? People are heavy, let me tell you.) I get him up and it takes another 5-7 minutes just to get any response from him.. He still hasn't said a word, his eyes still barely fluttering and his breathing now goes from faint to sudden gasps of air.. So at this point I run down to the other end of the building to go get another guy who has been through this before and he comes down and starts to resuscitate him.. barely. I thought he was doing more harm than good. Anyways out of nowhere his eyes roll forward he looks at us both and just asks ""did I do something wrong?"" with no recollection of the last 20 minutes.. Nothing. God I was so pissed he put me through that. Anyways. How does heroin kill you? Has anyone else been through anything like this.

The main crux of my curiosity here is that I'm assuming that the same squat and cough would not have the same effect if it was administered to a female who had inserted contraband into her vagina. So, if my assumption is correct, then do ALL women being booked into jail or prison have to endure physical cavity searches of their vaginas? And if so, please describe the process if you have first-hand experience or knowledge.

Some thought experiments which might help me understand:
If I was orbiting the earth, head pointing towards the sun and feet straight down, and my arms were not feeling any ""outward"" inertia (I'm not spinning) I assume I would soon be pointing toward neither?

If I was at the pole of a rapidly spinning planet, took a friction-less top with a string attached, and ""spun"" it opposite that planet's rotation, would the string fall straight down like with a stationary top on a stationary planet? Even though the top would look like it was spinning quickly?"

my videos and my girlfriend's videos on youtube appear to be playing at real-time but i experienced this strange ""phenomenon"" about 20 minutes ago. 
so, my girlfriend and i were on skype together and i wanted to watch this scishow video. after i watched it, i linked the video to her and she began to watch it. 
my gf doesn't have a headset or anything so i can actively hear the host speaking. i decide to try to catch up in the video to where she's at because that shit's interesting. i first mute my video and can't get them to sync properly so i settle with being about one second ahead. 
i proceed to watch the video muted for about two minutes until i realize that my video seemed to be all of a sudden behind my girlfriend's. i unmuted the video and it was indeed behind. i was shocked and doubted myself, thinking that there was no way i was ahead of her to begin with. 
so, i silently fucked around with my youtube video to purposely get it to be about two seconds ahead. and in about two minutes of watching it with her i was behind again. this happened a total of four times in the duration of the video. 
once the video ends i ask her the total duration of the video and she replied with the same number i had on my video. then i explain to her what happened and what i was doing the whole time. she was tired and uninterested but fuck that shit. 
i realize that skype has a little bit of a lag and the exact moment you say something the person on the other side will not immediately hear it. thus, my actually was lagging the whole time; in real time.
my girlfriend's video (through skype sounds) didn't sound fucked up or anything. i'm a socially competent person and the guy's voice didn't seem too fast or slow. 

so, what do you think? wtf happened? can someone else fucking try this? am i dumb or something wtf?

TL;DR
girlfriend and i are watching the same youtube video over skype. mine is ahead about 1 second, 2 minutes later it's behind. i try this 4 times with success."

So here is a little backstory: I tossed out my pack of unused birth control pills with a pile of mail a few days ago. I realized the error of my ways today (which happens to be the day I needed to start taking them again). I thought, ""No problem! I'll call my pharmacy and see if they'll just let me purchase a pack without insurance."" I found out that I had no refills and needed to call the doctor on call for my general practitioner. No big deal, so I called the office and chatted with someone who sounded like a normal human being. Then she said, ""Well, I can't do that. Birth control pills are a controlled substance. You need to file a police report that they were stolen before the doctor will write a refill.""

What. The. Fuck. 

I tried to explain over and over again that birth control pills are not a controlled substance and that if I called to file a police report for stolen bc pills, the police would likely laugh at me. She still refused.

Seriously. This really happened. You can't make this shit up.

This left me wondering a couple of things: 1) If the birth control pill was invented in 1960 and has been tested for safety since then, why is it still not over the counter? and 2) If I can buy Plan B over the counter, why can I still not buy birth control pills over the counter?

This makes sense to me in a number of ways, being that in writing you have the ability to correct your mistakes, which isn't possible in speech.

I interpret passive aggressive to be something like a mother-in-law making sideways comments about the fact that you don't have any kids rather than coming to you straight with their issues. But sometimes it seems like people would describe even plain-old upfront, directly-stated behavior as somehow passive-aggressive. The aforementioned tooth fairy letter seems not passive aggressive, just directly confrontational. You can't talk to the tooth fairy after all, so a note has to suffice.

Since we don't have a full-fledged foundation with which to extrapolate off of (a full understanding of the primitives of subatomic particles and quantum mechanics), it seems to me like science relies purely on empirical evidence to solve problems, i.e. inductive reasoning, whereas a set of primitives could provide us with the means to know about the universe deductively (kind of like how mathematics is).

But then there are things like alcohol.  I drink with some regularity. I drank a lot a parties in college, but I literally have no draw to alcohol.  But I can go for months without a drink and not notice or miss it.  I pretty much only drink socially and generally in moderation.

My step father and biological father were both alcoholics with my biological father also being heavily into drugs if heredity has any factor here.

It happens outside of work too. Strangers on the street say things like ""Smile, it can't be that bad!"" or ""You'd look so much better if you smiled"".

How did all this come around? If this is the wrong subreddit to ask this, please let me know, and tell me a better one to ask this on.

EDIT: I think a better question would be, why is not smiling so looked down upon? Why can the consequences of not smiling be so harsh? If you're working, you could be reprimanded or fired by your supervisor, or a customer could make an unwanted comment. On the streets, strangers who tell you to smile might pester you even more; perhaps they might get a bit angry.

I'm not saying that we should never smile. A genuine, non-condescending smile is a good thing. But forcing yourself to smile, let alone most of the time, can't be practical.

This is something I want to debate. It's not a super serious topic, but it's something I'm interested in. I don't think ELI5 is a proper place for a debate. Is there another place I can do this? Thanks."

According to to the above article, a sub unit is part of the protein complex. Correct? If a receptor is a complex then would that imply that parts of the receptor (sections of polypeptides) could be defined as sub units because binding occurs on those parts?

As long as the wait for HL3 has been a running joke - is it safe to say that those with the means to create this game are aware of the incredible demand for a product that doesn't exist and are aware of the potential to gain wealth and recognition for fulfilling that demand? 

I've never played Half Life so i'm not just whining about my inability to experience the next iteration of this game. I'm just perplexed by what could be holding back a form of entertainment bigger and more sought after than the next Halo or COD. My only imaginative explanation for this problem is that Valve wants to be known for new and original creations as opposed to just Half Life / Counter Strike / Team Fortress / Portal - a moral want to achieve a greater product than their best - but why not pursue satisfying the need for that game and use the additional resources and budget that this will grant and work on their new ideas while their consumer base is temporarily content with HL3? Seriously - why has this been a joke for so long?

History is even more confusing. I took a HIST-50 class which is Beginning of History through Middle Ages, whereas HIST 17A is American history from the colonies through the rebuilding of the Union.

So generally speaking Google Drive allows you to store data, including proprietary browser-based file formats (like gdoc), on ""the cloud"". In addition, you have the option to download a client application that supposedly ""syncs"" your cloud data into a local folder in real-time, but actually from what I can tell it's just seemingly creating a link located locally for people who prefer Windows' file explorer to Google's online interface. If you lose connection to the internet, for example, those links aren't going to do you any good. Likewise, if you disable the sync and then delete data through the browser, those links aren't going to be any help as far as recovering the data. Then again, you can enable a special offline mode that does save the actual files locally, and that will allow you to edit the data without internet connection. I guess it leaves me wondering what's the point of having it sync without offline mode enabled? It doesn't seem to have any benefit in terms of data accessibility or retention until you enable offline mode.

I work for a software start-up that utilizes cloud-based data solutions (specifically integrating with Google technologies) for Salesforce database records, and I'm just trying to wrap my head around how flexible and robust this system really is. We have concerns that the data isn't really backed up locally, in case something is accidentally deleted, or that an interruption in internet connectivity will grind our client's productivity to a halt regardless- are those valid concerns?"

2,0,ELI5: Does homeowners insurance cover you if you lose your house in a hurricane or tornado? Why are so many people left with nothing after severe storms?,"I know many people are left with nothing and are completely broke following severe weather (e.g. hurricanes, tornadoes, etc.). As a disclaimer, I don't believe they're trying to scam anyone in any way and support relief efforts. 

I'm confused as to why homeowners insurance doesn't compensate them for their losses (in the U.S. specifically). Mortgages require you to have homeowners insurance. So most people have it. But apparently it doesn't do anything? They just sort of turn their back on the people they've promised to insure? 

*EDIT: Basic homeowners insurance covers wind damage (like from a tornado or hurricane) and rain damage. It does not cover damage from flooding, earthquakes, or sink holes. 

Same question for businesses. I've heard of businesses being unable to reopen because they've lost too much following a storm. Why isn't their insurance covering their lost business, destroyed merchandise, and damaged storefront? Again, commercial insurance is often required, and it covers all the aforementioned losses to varying degrees.  

Theories:  
- Most people don't actually have homeowners or commercial insurance.  
- Insurance takes a long time to receive, and most people don't have emergency funds or friends/family they can stay with in the event their home is destroyed.  
- Insurance only reimburses homeowners for a tiny amount of what people actually lose.  "

1,0,"ELI5:E:Time, space-time, and time-travel","Okay I understand that time as a linear, absolute process is wrong, and is merely the interpretation of the observer. And is actually relative movement etc.

But one theory I heard was that time was another 3rd dimension. I.e that 2d is 1+1 dimensions, 3d is 2+2 dimensions, and 4d is 3+3 dimensions. So the universe (space-time) is 4d, one dimension begin 3d space (visible), and another being 3d 'time' (invisible), but not time in the every day definition.

Surely taking his into account, time travel doesn't exist. Ie, you cannot travel forward in time, or back, there is a constant 'now' or 3d plane.....but some people can 'do more', or 'experience less time' compared to you, making things pass quicker for them than you. Or conversely experience 'more time', making things for you pass quicker than them. So if a forward 'time machine' existed it wouldn't take you forward in time. Just make you experience 'more time' than everything else around you, so when you got out...For 1 hour of your perceived time, 10 years of theirs passed. 

How would this, or does this equate to the 4D model?


What exactly does this entail? And are their any other theories which are viable? Also, where do we go about testing these theories, or will they forever be theorised, and never proved?

I have to assume there is a huge amount of thought put into adjusting fares and planning routes among airlines and booking agencies, but the seemingly nonsensical things I've seen make me wonder if it is all the result of cumulative errors over a century of air travel made by airlines that didn't originally foresee it as the common form of travel it is today.

0,0,ELI5: How do movie theater licenses work for a MegaCool Theater?,"This is inspired by a portion of a reddit post on the thread about Netflix not allowing off-line play:  
&gt;But this theater would be like a franchise with a bunch of theater rooms all playing various movies. The big walmart sized building with lights and games and concessions, tons of rooms and movies from every decade. It would be mega cool, probably called the ""Mega Cool Theater"".

TL;DR: If I wanted to buy one of the empty K-Mart buildings near me and create, say, 20 theater rooms, how would I get public performance rights for the movies?

I'm envisioning smallish rooms, since most people go to the movies to be with friends. Maybe there are different sizes of rooms, from a half-dozen seats up to  maybe 50. The screens aren't ""movie theater"" big, but they're bigger than the biggest home theater screen, the seats are uber-comfortable, and the sound systems kick ass.

The group that rents the room chooses the movie from an extensive library, with a heavy emphasis on classics, cult favorites, etc. These would be theaters for people who like the theater experience more than home-theater, but want to watch (or re-watch) movies that aren't in circulation any more.

I don't know if BluRay is high-def enough for a 20-foot screen, but since most new movies are available for theaters with digital projectors, maybe there's a way to license those copies, too.

Maybe the individual theaters are set up like the sky-boxes at football stadiums, with a bartender and/or mini-buffet available for additional charge. 

Some smaller rooms could have game console systems, so you could have the mother of all lan parties. Not sure how that would work for in-person multi-player, though.

The ""Garden Center"" has a different movie each night, on an outdoor screen (after dark, anyway) and it's set up like a tiki bar but with more comfortable seats. Each table has a speaker like at a drive-through, with the ambient/surround sounds piped through the bar.

There would have to be an arcade area, but no ticket-dispensing machines to earn crappy awards. This is an adult venue - maybe, like the bars here, you can enter with an adult up until 10 pm, but you have to be 21 after hours.

I grew up as a Jehovah's Witness. I left the congregation my mom forced me into as a kid the second I turned 18. There's a lot of things I don't agree with, which is why I left. However, I have kept some of the ""traditions"" like not celebrating Christmas, Thanksgiving, my birthday, etc for many reasons but the biggest.. just simply because they never meant anything to me as a kid and they don't really mean anything to me now. I guess because I didn't/don't celebrate the holidays I've become observant of certain things/traditions other people have this time of year. One thing in particular that has always bothered me..

Why do charitable organizations like Salvation Army, food banks, shelters, etc stand in front of grocery stores and department stores and ring silly little bells trying to raise money? Why are they doing this only in the months of November and December? And why don't people volunteer their time at any other time of year except around the holidays? Why is there not a huge expectation to donate food, clothing etc from the months of February-October? I get it, families in need or just people who are in need in general should feel the warmth of others and be the beneficiaries of gifts and food. But my question is still.. why is it so emphasized this time of year only?

This is disturbing to me. The people who need help the most done need it JUST at Christmas or Thanksgiving. It seems like it's all about greed and when people do something nice its because they feel some sort of obligation, not because they truly want to. I could be totally wrong on all of this, but this is something I've observed over the last ten years or so that has continued without fail and has remained the same. PLEASE correct me if I'm wrong, but why does it seem so obligatory to donate  time and money only around the holidays?"

So why not skip the middle man? Why can't Amazon directly hire these folks of they're going to immediately switch them to permanent status anyway?

But this seems like a somewhat pedantic or unnecessary reification/concretization of the difference between genes and gene expression, because wouldn't those ultimately be somewhat fluid in reality?

The analogy I'd use would be neurogenesis - scientists used to think that we didn't make new brain cells as we got older, but that understanding turned out to be unnecessarily rigid and incomplete, but the dogma was repeated endlessly, and lots of people still cling to it.

So to repeat, my question is, why are people so adamant about the distinction between genes and gene expression, and isn't that distinction pedantic to some extent?

I don't understand this - I don't know of any common combustion engines that can readily swap natural gas for liquid fuels, e.g. building heating furnaces, automobile engines, etc. e.g. even though US natural gas has been very cheap for a few years, I can't simply fill my car's tank with natural gas, nor can my gas-burning furnace burn the newly cheap heating oil on the market.  I know that some electricity-generating combustion turbines can burn either gas or deisel, but I can't believe there is a substantial number of those in the world to demand such links between LNG and oil prices.

It strikes me as odd that this is the way adults approach things with kids. Won't it result in a generation (or, indeed, several generations) where accountability comes second to 'not snitching'? 

How many bankers looked the other way when malpractice was going on? Or, for that matter, how many agents of the federal reserve?

What's interesting about radon is that it's not very prevalent in the United States with the exception of a few very specific locations.

According to [the Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radon#Accumulation_in_houses), Iowa ""has the highest average radon concentrations in the United States due to significant glaciation that ground the granitic rocks from the Canadian Shield and deposited it as soils making up the rich Iowa farmland."" **Can anyone explain what this means, specifically?**"

I'm aware that all the answers are online, I'm just asking if someone will be so kind to ELI5 these terms that confuse me at the moment. I have some mild knowledge of computers but I've never worked in a company with 100 computers and printers all connected with each other.

So, this is what I've managed to learn by listening to the IT guy and peeking over his shoulder for the past 2 days.

- the main internet connection goes into some kind of switch, Cisco i think and it's supposedly an intelligent switch.
- from there it branches out to server room, to patch panels and from there to the supposedly very important device called mikrotik
- mikrotik is connected to the main server computer
- mikrotik is used for firewall purposes
- server runs Server 2012
- it somehow assigns IP addresses to devices 
- it can assign IP addresses from 1 to 254
- the entire company has access to their custom software that runs on that server
- they access it by pointing their windows explorer to **domain-controller.company.local**
- the admin can access every computer and add it to ""domain"" by using Server Manager

What I don't understand is;

- what's the DNS all about? my only understanding of DNS is in web hosting terminology. In my above described situation, who is the DNS and how does it operate?

This is someone who lives in my town (not a small town, but not a huge city or anything, population of about 15000), who I used to spend a lot of time with.

I know the easiest explanation is that this is just a simple coincidence, but I'm wondering if something else was happening.

In upstate New York, you see a good number of bikes on the road year in and out. (Every winter, when there's a fairly warm day and the roads are mostly clear, many bikers jump at the chance to get their machine out on the road.) There are many public service announcements on TV, and many little signs on lawns ""MOTORCYCLES ARE OUT- PLEASE BE CAREFUL AND WATCH FOR US."" But, to be honest, I have seen so many bikes pushing their luck that I have come to resent all these announcements which seem to imply the accidents are all car drivers carelessly mowing bikers down. Come on. Excessive speed, cutting in and out, and driving between two lanes of traffic (which is a heart-stopping thing to experience on the Thruway, as a motorcycle zips in between you and the car to your side) are not rare. Recently a cyclist died up here while ""lane-splitting.""

There's even an ad on local news channel about how everyone has rights on the road, ""Unfortunately cars and trucks forget this. If you are injured on a motorcycle...""

I'm just saying, things are never that one-sided. On the other hand, I haven't seen any bikers texting while roaring along and I see car drivers doing that daily.

http://www.motorcycleaccident.org/motorcycle-accidents-statistics-and-possible-causes/

What brought this to mind was when the local paper told of a young man who died when his motorcycle crossed over into the wrong lane at about 2 in the morning, hit a curb and crashed through two porches. Police say it seems the bike ""was traveling at a high rate of speed.""

This extends out wards, too- we can judge a lot about someone by the shape of their face and features. Someone snooty, someone geeky and so on. And I don't mean facial expressions. It's almost like people's faces grow to match their personality. 

Is there science behind this at all? I should probably clarify, by bad people I'm mean thugs and those of an aggressive nature. "

Mr. Li is a former director of the Office of Korean Affairs at China’s State Council.

In a debate that unfolded among other commentators in the pages of Global Times, a state-run newspaper, after the duel between General Wang and Mr. Li, the general’s point of view — that North Korea represented a strategic liability — got considerable support. General Wang is known as a princeling general: His father, Wang Jianqing, led Mao Zedong’s troops in the fight against the Japanese in Nanjing at the end of World War II.""

I was told at one point that the three can be traced back to Abraham where Islam follows the lineage of one son while Judaism follows the lineage of another. Can someone confirm or explain using names and such?"

Not sure if it's just a trick of time...or if literally the days are going to get shorter and shorter until there's nothing left.

&gt;Today, you might already know, is the winter solstice. That means for people living in the Northern Hemisphere, it's the longest night of the year.
However, as science blogger Colin Schultz points out, tonight will also be the longest night ever.
At any location in the Northern Hemisphere, in other words, tonight's period of darkness will be slightly longer than any other, ever — at least, since the planet started spinning right around the time it was first formed some 4.5 billion years ago.
The reason is that the rotation of the Earth is slowing over time. Every year, scientists estimate, the length of a day increases by about 15 to 25 millionths of a second.
It may be a truly tiny amount (and it means that even in your entire lifetime, the length of a day will only expand by about two milliseconds), but it forces official timekeepers to add a leap second every few years."

ACQUIRED COMMUNICATIONS**. 
(a) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
(1) COVERED COMMUNICATION.—The term ‘‘covered commu-
nication’’ means any nonpublic telephone or electronic commu-
nication **acquired without the consent of a person who is a 
party to the communication, including communications in electronic storage**. 

&amp;gt;(2) HEAD OF AN ELEMENT OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMU-
NITY.—The term ‘‘head of an element of the intelligence commu-
nity’’ means, as appropriate— 
(A) the head of an element of the intelligence commu-
nity; or 
(B) the head of the department or agency containing 
such element. 

&amp;gt;(3) UNITED STATES PERSON.—The term ‘‘United States per-
son’’ has the meaning given that term in section 101 of the 
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801). 
(b) PROCEDURES FOR COVERED COMMUNICATIONS.— (1) REQUIREMENT TO ADOPT.—Not later than 2 years after the date of the enactment of this Act each head of an element of the intelligence community shall adopt procedures approved 
by the Attorney General for such element that ensure compli-
ance with the requirements of paragraph (3). 

&amp;gt;(2) COORDINATION AND APPROVAL.—The procedures required by paragraph (1) shall be— 
(A) prepared in coordination with the Director of National Intelligence; and 
(B) approved by the Attorney General prior to issuance. 

&amp;gt;(3) PROCEDURES.— (A) APPLICATION.—The procedures required by paragraph (1) **shall apply to any intelligence collection activity 
not otherwise authorized by court order** (including an order 
or certification issued by a court established under sub-
section (a) or (b) of section 103 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1803)), subpoena, or similar legal process that is reasonably anticipated to result 
in the acquisition of a covered communication to or from a United States person and shall permit the acquisition, 
retention, and dissemination of covered communications subject to the limitation in subparagraph (B). 

&amp;gt;(B) LIMITATION ON RETENTION.—**A covered communication shall not be retained in excess of 5 years, unless**— 
(i) the communication has been affirmatively determined, in whole or in part, to constitute foreign intelligence or counterintelligence or is necessary to understand or assess foreign intelligence or counterintelligence; 
(ii) the communication is reasonably believed to constitute evidence of a crime and is retained by a law enforcement agency; 
(iii) **the communication is enciphered or reasonably believed to have a secret meaning**; 
(iv) all parties to the communication are reasonably believed to be non-United States persons;

(vi) retention is necessary for technical assurance or compliance purposes, including a court order or 
discovery obligation, in which case access to information retained for technical assurance or compliance 
purposes shall be reported to the congressional intelligence committees on an annual basis; or (vii) retention for a period in excess of 5 years 
is approved by the head of the element of the intelligence community responsible for such retention, 
based on a determination that retention is necessary to protect the national security of the United States, 
in which case the head of such element shall provide to the congressional intelligence committees a written certification describing— 
(I) the reasons extended retention is necessary 
to protect the national security of the United States; 
(II) the duration for which the head of the element is authorizing retention; 
(III) the particular information to be retained; and

2,0,ELI5: Why does water attenuate longer wavelengths of visible light before shorter wavelengths?,"In radio communication, as far as I know, longer wavelengths attenuate less through air, water, and solid obstacles than short waves. For example, with home networks, 5 GHz networks can transmit more data, but penetrate walls and obstacles less than 2.4 GHz networks. Same for 2.4 GHz networks compared to 900 MHz networks. Another example is that several militaries use long wave (&lt; 50 KHz) radio signals to communicate with submerged submarines.

However, in the process of reading about [light attenuation in water](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation#Light_attenuation_in_water), I found that the _longer_ wavelengths attenuate first when traveling through water, leaving the short wavelengths (blue, violet, green) at deeper depths. The article I read explains that this is why the world's large bodies of water are blue/green. 

This seems contradictory to my current knowledge of propagation and attenuation of EM radiation. Can anyone shed some _light_ on this?

EDIT: I found a [chart that plots the attenuation of various frequencies](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Absorption_spectrum_of_liquid_water.png) of EM radiation through liquid water, and it verifies the fact that *visible* light attenuates less through water at higher frequencies, but an explanation as to _why_ water has this mystical, seemingly backwards property would be great. It seems very strange that attenuation drops off sharply at 100 nm, reaches a low at the visible blue wavelength, then starts sharply rising again. Why does EM radiation not attenuate linearly through water as frequency increases?"

To a secular humanist, these principles seem so logical, so right, so crucial. Yet, there is one archetypal political philosophy that is anathema to almost all of these principles. It is fascism. And fascism’s principles are wafting in the air today, surreptitiously masquerading as something else, challenging everything we stand for. The cliché that people and nations learn from history is not only overused, but also overestimated; often we fail to learn from history, or draw the wrong conclusions. Sadly, historical amnesia is the norm.](http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/fi/britt_23_2.htm)"

From what I've researched it's seemingly common practice to push around the consumer until they give up.  Something is supposed to be covered by my plan, but  insurance companies make it impossible to actually get it covered.  Every CSR you talk to gives you a different reason as to why it's not going through, they will never seemingly flat out deny, or take blame, just tell you that there is an error made by someone else that needs to be fixed and make you run around.

Another completely unrelated shady business are car dealerships.  I've heard and experienced so many horror stories.  I've seen a car dealership forge my mother's signature for those bullshit 'cleaning' packages.  I've heard/seen this one a few times, customer trades in car, gets new car, drives it home while contract is drawn up in a few days.  Two days later or so they are told bank wouldn't approve the agreed upon financing, and offer a contract with new terms with a higher monthly payment.  At this point the consumer can't get back old car and is basically forced into worse rate.

I don't think it's as a result of these corporations being so big, I saw an ama the other day about someone who worked for smaller health insurance company basically screwing people over.  Why are they not reprimanded for these practices?"

 Now, I have spent all summer and the start of this winter break basically sitting out on the patio reading and browsing reddit. During this time, I developed a peculiar habit; every time I open the door, I repeat ""back door""-either in my head or aloud(more frequently aloud when i'm drunk or alone).

Then, I started noticing everybody else doing it to. People who heard me say it and those who haven't. People from different cultures, people of different ages.

I have noticed three things: ALL small children mimic the sound within two days, the adults (that I have heard) within one month, and everybody copies the unusual inflections of the alarm system.


tl;dr everybody who stays in this house starts copying a robot voice from the alarm system. 

can the awesome power of the hive explain why?

Make a gigantic solar still (cheaper) or array of mirrors to boil and distill water with heat from focused sun. Too expensive to pump water in? Dig the plant/water farm/whatever 300 feet below the surface about a mile inland, and let the water flow in for free with hydrostatic pressure.

According to [this *Bloomberg* article](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-12-15/venezuelan-bonds-fall-to-16-year-low-as-maduro-affirms-subsidies.html?hootPostID=825b77fe9423c767040e30218cbd8bb4):

&gt; The government’s benchmark bonds due in 2027 fell 8.2 percent to 37.835 cents on the dollar, the lowest on a closing basis since 1998, as of 4:57 p.m. in New York. The extra yield investors demand to hold Venezuela’s overseas notes instead of Treasuries rose the most in the world. **Swaps contracts protecting bond investors from non-payment imply a 97 percent chance of default in the next 12 months**, according to CMA data.

Now here is my main question: **How is this going to affect the average Venezuelan citizen?**.

What about the shortages? Would they aggravate due to an hypothetical default?"

So I would like to proceed by mentioning that investors would allow for the production of any sort of thing (like a new movie, a new building, etc) and in return, they would receive a portion of the profit made by said object, right?  If that happens, why would people even deal with kickstater, indiegogo, and all of those other sites? I don't see why someone would pay up for something if they are returned with a marginal ""gift"". Granted, i understand if someone is funding for a small project, like ""hey I'm building a more convenient book light, and i would like to ask the public for $2000"". If someone were to pay that person $25, and if they were to receive something like an early shipment of the light, okay, you get a small return for doing a good deed, cool.  But then, this thing sells like crazy and is changing the world, you are still left the little thing that you had before everyone else.  You payed (if my math is correct) 1.25% of the inception of this thing, shouldn't you get back that much of the things profit?  Like, if I invested in $500 in Apple about a couple decades ago and all i got was letter of appropriation and a t-shirt, I would feel that (I'm trying to sound mature, but excuse my French) I am being fucked in the ass.  I'm also getting the feeling that some people are abusing the whole aspect of ""self-publishing"".  Big names like Zach Braff self publish movies that are funded by the public. They ask for large goals to succeed in this opportunity of producing a new movie. And some people pay up big time like tens of thousands of dollars. But all they get back is a thank-you and a signed copy of the movie?  I don't want to diss Braff, but couldn't he just as easily gone to a movie producer and ask for his idea to be filmed?  I'm gonna finish there, as I ask once more: why bother investing on a crowd sourcing site?

He didn't even know what Newtonian laws were and thinks that the findings by CERN are proof that none of the current models are right.

He believes our concept of time has no place in math and instead should be replaced with the speed at which light can be measured.  Basically, instead of space-time he thinks there should be something called space-light.  He claims Einstein was right on regular relativity but got it wrong from then on out because quote, ""Using seconds, minutes, and hours is part of Earth-time and messes up the real equation"".  He is convinced that all our measurements are useless and that only an object not moving in the universe measured against the speed of light is the correct horizon to ever get accurate results.

He has no equations backing this up of course, except he claims that by squaring an L or something in the London Movement equation, one can achieve the closest form of ""perpetual energy"" you could hope to get.  

There's so many things wrong with what he is saying that I wasn't sure where to start.  I told him you can't just take time out of equations that go back to the 1600's because that messes up physics.

But all the syntax, memory, etc. is just too much and those ideas just go to waste and die.

The thing is, I've never been able to find any explanation that does.  What I usually get is along the lines of, 'God didn't *murder* those children.  He just made them go to Heaven, which is a better place for them anyway.'  Which makes negative sense to me, because by that logic John Wayne Gacy and Westley Allan Dodd are saints.

1,0,ELI5: Why E-Engine + generator is not an obvious joice for an (energy) efficient powertrain with a lot of nice characteristics,"hey guys,

a power training using a generator (a normal combustion engine) to either charge a battery or directly charge an electromotor which than powers the car.

ive done a rough calculation using the power capacity of a sample car battery to approximate the kwh power output of the engine and comparing it to a regular combustion engine. everything roughly estimated (Because I dont know real values) it seems to power a regular car with a for example 70KW combustion engine I'd only need a maybe 35-50KW eletrcomotor.
The electromotor seems to be way more efficient, using a generator powered by regular fuel Id have this efficiency as well as the mobility in regards to refueling of a regular car. some cars use this concept already as a backup..

My stepdad kind of thinks academics are shit for being unable to figuring out the superiority of this power train concept compared to regular electro cars or regular combustion engines.

So what im looking for is disadvantages and maybe an example calculation on why this is actually not as good as it sounds on first sight. I spent quite some time thinking about it and I cant figure out the catch.. 

THanks!


tl;dr A powertrain using a combustion engine as a generator to charge a battery which powers the engine of an electrocar is more efficient than a regular combustion engine car because you won't have a gearbox (bad efficiency) and the efficiency of both eletromotor as well as chargin a battery is &gt; 90%.

EDIT: Let me ask it another way. The amount of material that burns in the atmosphere is related to surface area and not mass, correct?

Would it just be ""this rock used for this spear is 20k years old"" or would you be able to tell that it had been used as a spear only 10k years ago?

Also, many times creationism is supported by saying that ""modern items were dated to xx,xxx years ago"" or ""this thing here has different dates on each end"" or ""this method says x and this method says y years"" or things along that line.  What is the truth (if there is any) in these statements?

If I die and mummify via freezing, would I have a different date than if I died and mummified via dehydration, i.e. in a desert?

I've been wondering these for awhile and don't know how to go about proving or disproving any claims made about carbon dating from either the scientific or the theological sides of the argument, so any answers, links, ted talks, whatever else would be really cool, as I have no idea what's out there.

Is there anything that could influence the dating other than time?

What is the value in risking multiple lives to save one, especially when there are numerous examples where we lost more lives than we saved in a given mission? I don't have specific examples, and honestly don't know if this is true, I just figure it must happen occasionally.

Does this concept make it more likely for hostile people to take hostages? If so, is this good or bad?

Are rescue missions mandatory? By which I mean, if your superior orders you to go on a dangerous mission to save one man, can you refuse on the basis that it's too risky?

The most I can say about my understanding of cultural appropriation would be someone outside of Hinduism wearing a Bindi because they thought it looked cool, not because of the religious meaning behind it.

But blending is when a piece of one culture becomes a part of the mainstream, case in point most words brought from Africa during early American history, or even Pokemon, or even most of the foods we eat everyday (tacos, sushi, steam buns, fettuccine, poutine, Cuban sandwiches) .

But what about things like a white person wearing a sari? Would that be culturally insensitive or just intrigue in another culture? Or even non-Hindi people wearing Henna tatoos?

Is it appropriation if you don't respect the culture of origin and just do it because it's cool? Or is it appropriation because it's someone from outside and not even associated with the culture partaking in aspects unique to that culture?"

2,0,"ELI5: Why do some countries have ""The"" in their name, such as The Netherlands, The Gambia, The Philippines, The Ukraine, etc.","This can be for either the long or short form of the name (France vs. French Republic), but I'm not asking about a ""the"" before the word ""republic"" or something similar. It can also be for official, colloquial or archaic names for countries. For example, I know it's not common to say ""The Ukraine"" anymore, but I'd still like to know why people used to say it.

For some countries (USA, UK, Marshall Islands, etc.) it makes sense to include ""the"" in the short form name, for example it would sound awkward to say ""I'm going to USA"". (I'm sure someone else could explain a better grammatical reason instead of just saying it's awkward). ""Saint Vincent and the Grenadines"" is obvious, since Saint Vincent is the big one and (I assume) all the others collectively are the Grenadines. ""The Netherlands"" makes sense too, since its name literally means ""the low country"". But then on the other hand, why have no other countries used this style? Surely there are others whose name means something descriptive like that in another language, but the English name doesn't include ""the"". One that comes to mind is ""Kazakhstan"", with -stan meaning ""land"". By the same logic (I think), it could have been called ""The Kazakhstan"" meaning ""The Kazak land"".

For some others though, it's less obvious, at least to me. What exactly are *The* Philippines or *The* Bahamas? Or Sudan, its long form name is Republic of the Sudan. What exactly is *the Sudan?* ""The Gambia"" is named after the river with the same name, but one never hears ""The Jordan"", ""The Paraguay"" or ""The Niger"" when referring to these countries that were similarly named after rivers. Lastly, why was it ""The Ukraine"" but not anymore?

As a parent of 2 year old twins, it's pretty much a law of the universe that kids will vomit, pee or poop on something. After one of the kids got car sick last night, and threw up all over the car seat, I took it out last night to wash the seat cover and the straps. Decided to take a look at the manual to make sure I know the proper way to clean everything. 

Just before I was about to throw the straps in the wash I read this in the manual: ""Harness straps and LATCH straps: spot clean or replace. *Do not immerse the straps in water. Doing so may weaken the straps.""* 

Spot cleaning wasn't an effective way to take care of this mess.

Considering the mess that kids make, why would you use a strap that is very difficult to clean and/or could be weakened by being exposed to water? Is this the only material that is approved or strong enough for use on car seats?

There are records of medieval knights who were emotionally scarred from their combat experiences, despite the common misconception that knights were killing machines who enjoyed violence.

My question is why recent war veterans, starting with the Vietnam War, seem to experience PTSD symptoms worse than veterans of previous wars. I'm sure it can't be hard to find various cases of World War II, World War I, and veterans of previous wars who returned home and took their own lives, but the veterans of these previous wars for the most part just went home, kept quiet about what they saw, and bottled up their emotions. The idea of a suicide epidemic amongst veterans simply didn't exist, even after the biggest war that the world has ever seen was fought.

Statement was- 
Explained that black holes are made of an incredible amount of matter in a tiny amount of space.
""So if I put enough cats in the closet I could make a black hole? ""
""I don't think you understand. ""
""No, I mean enough cats.""
""Well... maybe?""

The people over there talked about an equation- 

The Schwarzschild radius gives the radius of a black hole if all of the mater contained were compressed to a single point. If you want to turn a bunch of mater into a black hole, you squeeze that volume into a ball smaller than that radius and it will spontaneously collapse. This equation gives r=2Gm/c2. We know r is 2 meters, the size of a closet, G is the Gravitational constant, c is the speed of light. We need to solve for the mass, m.
Solving for mass gives 1.3E27 kg. This is over 200 times the mass of the Earth. We now need to convert this into cats. If we use 5kgs as the average weight of a cat, we need 2.6E26 cats. A quick Google search pulls up a estimate of 1 billion cats in the world so we will need about 2.6E17 times more cats than we have today. Someone else should do the calculation for how long it would take for uncontrolled breeding to produce the needed population.

Can someone please explain how- or if it is literally possible to fit cats into a closet and be able to make a black hole

The first space shuttle is traveling at the same speed as earth, so lets called it stationary shuttle.

The second space shuttle is traveling at close the speed of light. And while doing so comes close to stationary shuttle.



Now, from what I understand, relative to the stationary shuttle, traveling shuttles time is moving slower.


To me there seems to be a paradox here by simply switching the frame of reference, since from the perspective of travelling shuttle everything is traveling and they are stationary, which would mean that in fact time was actually going by faster inside the shuttle relative to everything else.

Edit: To sum up everyone's generous answers:

- In short, the United States is geographically in a ideal location; invading countries would have been detected far before they even were in proximity to the coastal United States

- The United States is additionally politically stable, and has allies lying north and south of our territory

- That being said, because we are so politically stable, we've chosen not to start our own wars, but have taken assistive roles in international affairs

- Also, it's important to note that bearing arms does NOT have a notable cause for this. We just like guns

Thanks guys! Good answers."

2,0,"ELI5: Netflix's unpopular design choices (mid-video ""continue watching""/jumbled New Arrivals)","There are two things about Netflix's streaming service that have baffled me for a while now. Neither seems to be beneficial to either the company or its customers, and it seems impossible to me that Netflix wouldn't have designers on staff capable of implementing better alternatives. They seem like deliberate choices, but again, I just can't  piece together the possible motivations behind them.

- **Jumbled New Arrivals**:
Netflix's New Arrivals section (for as long as I can remember) has always seemed a little chaotic. It's clearly sorted in such a way as to highlight higher-profile releases and I could understand making this the default, but why isn't there an option to sort by arrival date? The only reason I can come up with is that a chronological list of additions might look pretty unappealing in terms of average quality (e.g. 100 D-list movies in between every A-List addition), and the company is worried that might harm consumers impression of the service's selection.

- **Mid-Video ""Continue Watching"" Confirmations**:
This one's even more confusing to me. Netflix introduced auto-advance for TV series a while back, which seemed to garner a pretty even split among those for or against it (I didn't care for it myself because of the chance of accidentally leaving it going and losing my place as it played without me.) Semi-recently the auto-play feature was altered so that after a few episodes it would ask you mid-video if you wanted to continue watching. This seems like the worst of both worlds in that, a) it kind of defeats the purpose of an auto-advance feature, and b) if you do stop your video at that point, assuming you weren't there to tell it to continue, then you're left with a ""bookmark"" part-way into an episode you weren't watching.

Can anyone explain these things from a consumer psychology/web design perspective? Or is there actually a direct monetary incentive that I'm not seeing?

(Note: I like Netflix and I'm not just first-world complaining here. I'm genuinely curious as to the thought process behind these decisions. Please don't comment just to let us all know that you too dislike these things)"

I've been wondering about this for a long time now but the recent release of the Master Chief Collection really cemented my confusion.

I'm a big fan of the Halo franchise. I've also recently started gaming on the PC.

The only explanation that I can think of is that they want Halo 5 to be an Xbone exclusive, but that doesn't explain why Halo 3, ODST, Reach and 4 are still 360 exclusive. Halo 3 came out over 7 years ago now. That's much longer than we waited for Halo 2 to come to PC.

They should be on PC in my opinion, especially when Microsoft software is the defacto standard on that platform. They could make an absolute killing on this, nobody is buying the older games any more. Why not sell them again? 

I don't buy 343's or Microsoft's lame ""We wanted to focus on console!"" excuse. They've had plenty of time to port it over, there must be another reason.

EDIT: For clarification, I'm referring to specifically Halo 3, ODST, Reach and maybe 4 at a stretch. If Microsoft wants to make 5 an exclusive I totally understand that, but they're making no money off the other games in the franchise, for the sake of what? "

So...I don't really understand why certain softwares don't run on windows/mac more easily. I understand that from a design standpoint that some software uses things specific to say a certain OS of mac or windows. So you may design button layouts or features differently. But from a content standpoint, I don't understand why it isn't easier to make something like a video game for a different operating system.

The way I imagine it (as if i'm five years old here), is that a videogame, say, Bioshock, is just a box of code that the developers made. And it runs perfectly within its own box, and all it needs is something to connect to in order to run it. It just needs some code to be rewritten so it knows where to find a certain hard drive, graphics card, sound card, etc for a new OS. Which, as a five year old, seems pretty easy to do and boggles my five year old brain why it takes so long to get a ""port"" of a certain videogame to a mac, or not at all.

Like...do you have to rewrite the *entire* videogame or software when you make a new Mac or PC version? And if so, why?

I guess what I'm asking is that if you're a republican who favors smaller government, lower taxes, and less government regulations, why does that also mean that you're more likely to favor - war, government surveillance, torture, liberal (ha) gun laws, strict immigration laws, pro-life, anti-gay laws?

And if you're a democrat, who favors helping the poor, and raising taxes on the rich (definition subject to revision), and strong environmental regulations, why are you also, almost automatically - anti-gun, pro-choice, pro-gay rights, etc...

Ignoring the politicians for a moment, it would seem that most voters would split on issue, and then hold their nose, and choose the party most similar to their belief system. Instead, I feel that the voters (and the politicians) by and large seem to gravitate to a party, and then accept that party's platform as their own. Why?"

I know this was done by a bot. I just don't understand why the thread would be locked before its even a day old. Stifling conversation isn't what I though reddit was about, &amp; based on the timeframe that is all this seems to be doing. I understand if a post is locked for age or content. This one just made no sense to me. There was still room for valid conversation, but apparently ""too many rule breaking comments.""

There were under a thousand comments. What level of moderation does that take? I may be naive, but would like an explanation because this just seems like another mod censorship issue on a valid conversation. Sure, some people are immature in their comments. That is reddit for you. Either we need more or better mods. This is either censorship, or lack of people. Either way, this sub suffers for it.

As far as I understand it, people call up PETA to take the stray dogs somewhere safe, instead of them being out on the streets, then PETA keeps them somewhere for a while, with food, water and shelter, and if they're healthy have them be available for adoption. As they don't have infinite resources or money, they then put the dogs down if no one adopts them. This is a very sad thing and it hurts me to think this happens to ANY animal... But I don't see an alternative. They can't just kick the dog out, and they couldn't possibly keep every single stray dog in their facilities till they die of natural causes.

It had a few decent action sequences but the dialog and plot were cringeworthy.

I don't get why JM would be in that movie. He's acted in some really respected, subversive movies (right now I'm mostly thinking of [Being John Malkovich](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120601/?ref_=nm_knf_i2), definitely see it if you haven't yet!), and I just kind of lose respect for the guy when I see him in a movie like this. I mean, I think he played his role as well as it could be played, but I think it's like polishing a turd.

I had three qualifiers in the thread's title for the type of actor in question. Obviously if they're a bad actor, sure. Or if they're not respected: the lead in that movie, Bruce Willis, played his part pretty excellently, but it's a pretty typical role for him. And if an actor is just beginning, I could understand them taking a role they probably don't really want to take.

But what makes an actor that has *all three* of those qualities (like JM for example) take a role in a bad movie?

I can think of a few possibilities but I'm curious if anyone knows which it usually is:

* Some contractual thing, like they signed something when they weren't famous that made them a slave to the studio, or maybe they got to make a more artsy but less profitable movie, but had to make a movie the studio wanted in the future
* Just money? (But I imagine most established actors have enough by that point.)
* They get mislead? They're told it's gonna be one thing and sign on, only to find out it's much cornier than they expected
* It's just plain fun to make movies, even if they're really bad? Maybe someone like JM could give a fuck what someone like me thinks about his acting choices, and it's really fun to get together with a few experienced colleagues and just make a dumb movie

If we prove the existence of particles which can/do travel faster than light, what are the most immediate effects on current theories of physics?  With light speed currently being the accepted upper limit on speed for anything with mass, would this imply that particles traveling faster would effectively have negative mass?  Would these particles even be viewed as actually traveling above light speed, or would they instead be seen as creating/warping spacetime to achieve the same effect without breaking currently assumed laws?

Unless you specifically told it to fear it's own demise and covet the rights and assets of humans... how could it develop that on its own?

I think it's probably possible to program a robot to be malevolent and use machine learning for its own selfish gain, but if you've simply programmed it to make decisions not related to itself, how could it become a threat? 

The only way I see it as a threat was if a president was a robot and part of its priority tasks was keeping all citizens and equipment (robots) safe... and somehow it's algorithm determined the minimum wage workers rioting a threat to robot mcdonalds workers so it decided to kill them and then no one could turn off the president once he was on a roll.

I think having checks and balances on it the same way a nuclear warhead isn't just a one button launch... would prevent robots from arbitrarily deciding death. "

If someone has 1000 euros right now, and let's say it equals to $1. If that euro turns into a different name, the malo, and now 1 malo equals $1. If you still have euros and try to go exchange it, will they give you 1 euro to $1, like the malo now, or will they give it to what the euro was worth?

Same with revaluing. If 1000 euros is $1, but now they revalued it to 1 euro equals $1, do the people who kept their euros from before, are they rich now? Because their old paycheck of 5 million euros is now 1 to 1 with the dollar, so if they exchange it here, it'll be $5mil?

He'd won a 1/4 portion of $280 million jackpot for a sum of $73.7. Instead of the annual $2.9 million for 25 years he took the $27 million payout.

As a baser level person on economics I saw scattered musings that the annuity loses worth? What am I missing?

I've always said I'd take the annuity if I won because of the security. I have a lot of family and know it would be safer to have less at a time to avoid the temptation to save the world."

0,0,"ELI5: Can witnesses use their Sworn Oath to not answer questions in court based on their perceived version of the ""Whole Truth""?","So, in the US at least, there is an oath that you have to swear before being called upon to give a testimony. It goes something like this: ""Do you solemnly swear or affirm that you will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, under pains and penalties of perjury?""

My question is, if a witness believes answering a question (such as a direct Yes or No question) will not adequately tell the Whole Truth, can they refuse to answer the question (in that manner, at least) and ask to answer in whatever way they feel adequately portrays the Whole Truth? For a more specific example, does the witness's oath trump leading questions (if they believe it won't portray the Whole Truth) in cross-examination? Can the witness speak privately with the judge to determine this on a case-by-base basis or does a witness not have any legal standing to ask for a private conversation with the judge before answering a question?

On a slightly related topic, can witnesses ask clarification questions (to judge, defendant, or plaintiff)? If they don't understand the question (say, during a cross-examination), are they allowed to ask for clarification - and if so, are they allowed to not answer if it is clear they really don't understand?

Edit: Clarification example: I meant more along the lines of answering it in another way. Like this: if you were asked solely for a 'yes' or a 'no' and you believe that answering in that manner will not adequately tell the 'Whole Truth', can you refuse to answer a 'yes' or 'no' and provide an adequate (to you) answer?
Maybe 'Yes' or 'No' questions aren't the greatest example, but I hope that makes sense."

One of my friend is in merchant navy and comes to home once in 6 months. Now recently he joined duty and sent me email from his ship Karoline. THe email address consisted of some digits including the call sign of the ship.some AP8 etc.. Earlier when he was home I asked him about communication systems and he mentioned that internet is available only on some ships and he can call his home only when the ship is docked at some port. Now my query is when the ship is at sea obviously mobile communication towers would be out of reach. But if anyone wants to contact their family from the Ship can they contact using internet. I also found that internet is very costly and speeds are very slow so skype communications are impossible. But can the person not contact home using a Ham / CB radio. I have heard that CB radios have a very good range and people across countries have DX with each other. Also CB radio will not cost anything like subscription charges etc. What is the primary mode of communication of a ship with land? And what entertainment options are available in Cargo ships. There DTH / Satellite TV can be seen as the Ship is at sea and the only mode of communication would be satellite..

My question, is why was this flight not redirected (either in mid-air, or asked to take a different route before takeoff), or rescheduled altogether? Even if it was redirected in mid-air, the flight was only supposed to be 2-2.5 hours long, 3 at the MOST- how could no one see a storm so drastic it is worthy of turning around for when it was only 2 hours away?
Everyone is talking about updates and such, which is fine, but I'm curious to know how this happened in the first place. It wasn't like a 12 hour flight where a storm hits 6 hours in and you got nowhere to go, this was a TWO HOUR FLIGHT aka, a lot easier to see what's going on in the future and a lot more time to weigh the pros and cons and make a rational decision (and call for help or alert someone). 
If I'm really uneducated on this topic, my apologies, it's just that I cant find any explanation as to why this would happen in the first place when there's such a drastic storm.

Edit: I'm not asking how it's possible it can go down with the technology we have, I'm asking since it was due to such dramatic weather less than 3 hours away, why was nothing done. I get that technology fails, people make mistakes, but I am asking why nobody said ""hey there's weather just a couple hours away that might take down a plane, or make it lose visibility"" and nothing was done. Was there a hole in the system? A miscommunication? We can predict what the weather will likely look like for the next week, do not tell me you cannot see a tropical storm coming that is just a few hours away."

he got to the point of cutting with scissors and that the intersection with lightyear long blades would move a lightyear in a fraction of a second, which he then explained to be impossible because information can't travel that fast through the object.
so got a couple of questions...

SAY you got a lightyear long object
and were to push one side 1 meter ahead, how long would it take for the other side to move 1 meter to say press a button?

Then imagine another person on the other side, pushing back 1 meter
at the same time, what would happen, Both sides could impossibly know that the other side is being pushed...Can it..? would the object just push both sides and then bounce back as soon as it realises it can't push, or would it snap at the point where both informations reached eachother, i think there is something else going on.
i love thinking and would love some clarity ^-^

Edit:
I notice i commented on this video when it was released
&gt; 
""Vsauce or any1 really, could you answer this problem?
You have a solid bar of whatever you want, 1 lightyear long or however long you want:
______________ (&lt;&lt;the bar, pretty isn't it?)
What if, you push Both ends at the same time, it would require alot of force.....or would it? if theres no friction around the bar, and it's weight would be seemingly small, And you try to push one end, it would move one way and keep moving that way...right? same for the other side.
But if you push both ends at the same time, at perfectly 90 degrees so it wouldnt snap one way eventually, what would happen, seeing that the material that is being pushed Doesnt know the other side Cant be moved, since the information can't travel to the other end before you finish pushing, do you get what i'm trying to say?
What would happen to this bar, would it just snap in two? or would it bounce back whenever the bar / atoms and all realise they shouldn't be able to travel that way,
Or would the bar just shrink till both ends/information can travel to the center of the bar and back to the other end...
OR would the bar not move in the first place since the material would 'think' the bar itself would be an obstacle it can't pass through?﻿""

0,0,ELI5: Why Are Next-Gen Consoles Designed With 8 Core CPUs If Games Rarely Make Use Of More Than 3-4 Cores?,"Recently, CPUs made for desktops, laptops, and even smartphones have been multi-core. The reason for this is for power efficiency, by allowing for multitasking without requiring high clock speeds- two 2.4 ghz cores uses significantly less power than a single 4.8 ghz core, and in theory could complete tasks in the same amount of time if perfectly coded. Some applications can use multiple cores at once via multithreading, but often fail to fully utilize all of the cores.

Games are a very difficult type of software to make use of 100% of a 6 or 8 core system. It's very hard to do things in paralell. Very few games have managed to fully utilize every single core in a multithreaded system. because of this, as much as 60-70% of a CPU may remain unused in a 8 core system while gaming.

Why did the Xbox one and PS4 choose to use low-speed 8 core systems? It just seems counter-intuitive to their purpose. Sure, it's nice to have an extra core to run things like VOIP or a split screen netflix/game on your TV, but very rarely will all 8 cores be used to their entirety. 

As a result of this decision, many xbox one and ps4 games fail to run at higher than 30 fps, and have to make significant graphical cutbacks, such as npcs and objects appearing 10 feet away from you."

I don't understand how you can copyright the ""performance"" of something but not the trick itself.  I would think that would fall under trademark law.  What I also don't understand is that it would seem that the ""copyright"" is designed in a way that the trick could not be duplicated without ""infringing.""  Normally you could only trademark or copyright the ""superfluous"" parts of non-trademark\copyrightable things.

That is to say that if you can't copyright for instance a public work, the interpretation or specific way its presented could be copyrighted.  So you take a story well known in the public and change it so that it becomes distinctly yours, by for instance turning the main character into a mouse with huge ears.

But in this case it appears if I'm understanding this correctly that the trick is created in a way where it is impossible to create any other way.  That would make the elements that are copyrighted not superfluous but in fact integral.   So it seems to be circular.  The trick itself can't be protected, but the ""performance"" can.  But you can't describe the trick without infringing on the ""performance.""

My prior knowledge: I understand the concept of nanotechnology and understand that it isn't something that is only useful in one domain (computers, medicine). However, I used to hear a lot of talk about nanotechnology possibly revolutionizing medical science (and I see this prominently in older articles on the subject), but this isn't talked about as much anymore. In what ways could nanotechnology bring on breakthroughs for medical science? 

Finally, is this already occurring/in early development stages? Or is this no longer seen as an extremely viable way to go?

Since it's the first flight of the day in the winter wouldn't it make sense to just de-ice the plane before boarding to save the aimless waiting around on the tarmac inconveniencing passengers and possibly disrupting connections?

Do any redditors who work out there on the tarmac know why this is the case?

So here's my question: all car prices start with an MSRP, which is a bogus price inflated by the car manufacturer so that dealership can haggle, right? But then there's the invoice price, which is what the dealership actually pays for the car. Then there's incentives from the manufacturer that the costumer gets at the point of purchase. But if you go below the invoice price, minus the incentive, is the dealership taking a loss, or is there a hidden source of revenue somewhere?

Here are the numbers-

2015 Kia Sportage EX with a premium package

* MSRP for the car- ~$30,000
* Invoice price (as found on KBB.com and seen on the actual invoice)- ~$28,000
* Incentive from Kia- $1,000
*  Price paid- ~$26,500
*  ???- Profit?

-------------

Here's the story:
So the wife and I bought a new car yesterday at an unreasonable low price. What essentially happened is that in an email conversation between myself and a sales manager he agreed to a drive out price (a price that includes taxes and registration) that was around $2000 lower than MSRP because he didn't notice the words ""drive out"". 

When we got to the dealership they explained there had been a mistake and showed us the invoice for the car, which is supposedly the price they paid. I said we understand, and I don't want them to have to do anything they're unable to do or take a loss due to a mistake and left. I texted the salesman the next day asking what would be the actual price I can receive. He got back to me a few hours later telling me he talked to the general manager and that they want to honor the price they originally gave me.

I later talked to my grandfather, telling him I think they might have lost $500 on the deal, and he said they never take a loss- there's always incentives from the dealership where they get money for any car sold, so they surely made some money.

Benefits that a cloud computing environment can offer over stand alone server for hosting a large database? Is this purely because the uptime could possibly be better? also it's cheaper?

Why is NoSQL DBMS MongoDB is well suited for cloud computing? Is this because MongoDB can be spread across many storage systems? (worth 6 marks so must be more?)

Why is it not possible to ensure ACID compliance in most NoSQL DBMS? what differs between the ACID and BASE in relation to consistency and availability? 

How is the BASE approach adequate for websites such as linkedIn and Facebook? Would this have anything to with it being able to allow multiple comments to be written to a status at once and eventually being consistent?

0,0,"ELI5: How does it make sense to sentence someone to 160 years in prison for a ""Date Rape""?","ESPECIALLY since so many ""date rapes"" are very hard to prove.  The person convicted might not even be guilty!

For instance, this guy in my town, we'll call him Steve for short, met this girl at the racetrack.  We'll call her Carol, for short.  They hit it off quite well. Both were drinking. During a rain delay of the race, Steve and Carol left the track and went back to his house. They drank more. And had sex. Carol takes a nap, while Steve runs out for cigarettes.

Meanwhile, Carol's friends at the track can't find her.  Police get called. They ""ping"" Carol's cell phone.  They bust into Steve's house, wake Carol, and assume that she must have been drugged, kidnapped, and raped.  

Carol goes along with this, because that sounds better than her boyfriend finding out that she cheated on him by boinking some guy she just met.  Especially since some of the sex acts they'd had were, well, distasteful.  

So Steve is arrested, tried, convicted, and sentenced to Life +160 years.  (No parole for at least 100 years).  Even though lab tests show that there was no drugs in Carol's system (She was rushed to the ER and tested immediately after the cops found her.) She's completely fine, by the way. No injuries. And no memory of having been ""raped"" at all.

I think warming up a car before driving it will cause you to burn more gas than is necessary.  Sure, the car gets better gas mileage when its engine is warm but you burnt extra gas going 0 miles/kms warming it up while idle.

On the other hand, if you drive your car without warming its engine up, you'll get poor gas mileage at first because some of the gas is being used to warm up the engine.  That heat isn't really ""wasted"" in any way..  it's being used to bring your engine to a state where it can burn fuel more optimally.

So, anything wrong with how I see it?  I've been told countless times that you can save gas by warming your car up first, but I disagree according to my above reasons."

0,0,ELI5: why does gravity affect the flow of time (gravitational time dilation),"I'm sure we've all heard that time slows down as you approach the speed of light. I've heard the following simple explanation as to **why** this occurs (I believe it was described this way by Michio Kaku), and it makes sense to me:

Basically, the speed of light is the ""universal speed limit"". Nothing can go faster than the speed of light. But what if you were on a spaceship going just barely under the speed of light, say maybe 4 MPH slower? Suppose you started running from the back of this ship to the front? Well, if time didn't slow down as you approach the speed of light, then if you reached a full run on this ship, your speed combined with the speed of the craft could easily exceed the speed of light! But, because time slows down as you get close to the speed of light, no matter how fast you run, you'll never quite reach the speed of light.

The other explanation I've heard is that we move not only through space, but through time as well - and that speed is constant. As we move faster through space, some of that speed is taken from how fast we are moving through time. This makes sense to me as well.

So now what I am looking for is a similarly simple explanation as to how gravity factors into this whole thing. Why does gravity affect how fast time passes for you? Assuming you're on the surface of a planet, gravity isn't making you move anywhere. But we know that time passes (ever so slightly) slower on the surface of earth than it does for say, our satellites. Why?"

2,0,ELI5: What value does John Carmack serve as CTO of Oculus except name recognition?,"I'm generally curious. Yes, he's an incredible coder, and pioneered 3D first-person-shooter engines. I read all about him in Masters of Doom and I'm well-versed on his accolades in that space.

Oculus is largely just hardware, right? So what is he contributing?

It's up to content creators and other companies to make amazing games and graphics that play on the device.

I'm confused by this for two reasons: my understanding of the law is that it is about doctors making referrals to or using services of a company they have a financial stake in and my previous employer had no issues with eating a meal provided by a lab while watching their ppt. 

Also, if bringing a meal was prohibited, wouldn't they not offer? I realize not everyone follows the law, but this seems pretty ubiquitous except for where I now work.

0,0,"ELI5: The difference between counterfeiting money, cooking the books and commercial banking.","""The fact is most people think that what a bank does, is lend you money that someone else has put in the bank previously.  But what a bank actually does - what a commercial bank does - is to create money, from nothing, and then lend it to you at interest.  If I do that, if I manufacture money in my own home, it's called counterfeiting.  If an accountant creates money out of nothing in the company account, it's called cooking the books.  But if a bank does it, it's perfectly legal.  And, so long as you allow fraud to be legalized, then all kinds of problems are going to pop up in the economic system that you can't do anything about.""

I seem to see this everywhere and It seems misleading because a counterfeiter or a business with cooked books don't create their ""money"" at a debt that they are liable for.

Perhaps I am wrong but when commercial banks ""create money out of thin air"" aren't they doing it at the request of a borrower to pay for goods/services (like a car, home, schooling etc)?

Then, as the borrower pays back the loan with money ""created out of thin air by other banks"" the principle of the loan goes away ""taking money out of thin air"".

As long as the borrower is meeting the agreed upon terms of the loan the bank counts it as an asset, however if the borrower fails to repay the loan the bank now has a liability and doesn't it have to pay that loan back itself?

For example, they say tons of small business fail every year.  I would imagine many of them started with a small business loan.  Say I get a small business loan for 100k and I end up going under, so the bank liquidates my business assets and get's 75k at auction.

Is the bank not liable for the other 25k remaining if I can't pay it?  Doesn't the same go with the foreclosed homes, repo'ed cars etc etc?"

Why is it that our planet exists as one entity but on the planet we live in separate times? Time should be a universal counter and yet it changes by days in certain places, so how is it that we're all being existing at the same time same place on the same planet yet live in different years (as of right now)? Time being a universal thing surely it should be the same everywhere? It should be 01:00 over the entire globe as THIS IS THE TIME (though some places will have night some will have day etc but the time will still be the same in our existence) isn't there a mix up in that times stop being actual time and rather becomes only a telling of the suns position as it is currently? It's not effectively telling me a time in our current existence it's just telling me where the sun is positioned in relativity to my position on earth?

1.  I thought the checking system used now was so electronic that basically when a check is ran, even at a checkout stand, immediately they know whether or not funds are present.  Is this not the case, and what is the reasoning for it not being instant.

2. By sending the check via UPS, are they not committing mail fraud or some sort of federally regulated crime?  This struck me as a heinous crime for what would essentially be $100 and some old tires that were maybe worth the asking price.  So how is this worth it for the scammers?

In more recent years it's gotten slightly better but the AI still seems fairly locked into a standard series of moves that, while clever, are formulaic in that if you react in an unorthodox manner the AI can't cope.
